<h2><a href="#the-strange-history-of-this-book">The strange history of this book</a></h2>
<p>In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming class in Java. I had taught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.</p>
<p>One of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all suffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much new material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.</p>
<p>Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize the jargon and define each term at first use.</p></li>
<li><p>Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult topics and split them into a series of small steps.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I needed a title, so on a whim I chose <em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em>.</p>
<p>My first version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting topics and (most important) letting the students practice.</p>
<p>I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book.</p>
<p>What happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the unusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book.</p>
<p>Jeff and I revised the book, incorporated a case study by Chris Meyers, and in 2001 we released <em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python</em>, also under the GNU Free Documentation License. As Green Tea Press, I published the book and started selling hard copies through Amazon.com and college book stores. Other books from Green Tea Press are available at <greenteapress.com>.</p>
<p>In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the first time. The contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more interesting projects, and generally had a lot more fun.</p>
<p>Over the last five years I have continued to develop the book, correcting errors, improving some of the examples and adding material, especially exercises. In 2008 I started work on a major revision—at the same time, I was contacted by an editor at Cambridge University Press who was interested in publishing the next edition. Good timing!</p>
<p>The result is this book, now with the less grandiose title <em>Think Python</em>. Some of the changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I added a section about debugging at the end of each chapter. These sections present general techniques for finding and avoiding bugs, and warnings about Python pitfalls.</p></li>
<li><p>I removed the material in the last few chapters about the implementation of lists and trees. I still love those topics, but I thought they were incongruent with the rest of the book.</p></li>
<li><p>I added more exercises, ranging from short tests of understanding to a few substantial projects.</p></li>
<li><p>I added a series of case studies—longer examples with exercises, solutions, and discussion. Some of them are based on Swampy, a suite of Python programs I wrote for use in my classes. Swampy, code examples, and some solutions are available from <thinkpython.com>.</p></li>
<li><p>I expanded the discussion of program development plans and basic design patterns.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of Python is more idiomatic. The book is still about programming, not Python, but now I think the book gets more leverage from the language.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to program and think, at least a little bit, like a computer scientist.</p>

<h1><a href="#coding-style"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Coding Style</a></h1>
<p>Now that you are about to write longer, more complex pieces of Python, it is a good time to talk about coding style. Most languages can be written (or more concise, formatted) in different styles; some are more readable than others. Making it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps tremendously for that.</p>
<p>For Python, PEP 8 has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style. Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the most important points extracted for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.</li>
<li>4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.</li>
<li>Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.</li>
<li>This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.</li>
<li>Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.</li>
<li>When possible, put comments on a line of their own.</li>
<li>Use docstrings.</li>
<li>Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4).</li>
<li>Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use CamelCase for classes and lower_case_with_underscores for functions and methods. Always use self as the name for the first method argument (see A First Look at Classes for more on classes and methods).</li>
<li>Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case.</li>
<li>Likewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is only the slightest chance people speaking a different language will read or maintain the code.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a href="#functions"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Functions</a></h1>
<p>Functions ———</p>
<p>In Python, a <strong>function</strong> is a named sequence of statements that belong together. Their primary purpose is to help us organize programs into chunks that match how we think about the problem.</p>
<p>The syntax for a <strong>function definition</strong> is:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> NAME( PARAMETERS ):
    STATEMENTS</code></pre>
<p>We can make up any names we want for the functions we create, except that we can’t use a name that is a Python keyword, and the names must follow the rules for legal identifiers.</p>
<p>There can be any number of statements inside the function, but they have to be indented from the <code>def</code>. In the examples in this book, we will use the standard indentation of four spaces. Function definitions are the second of several <strong>compound statements</strong> we will see, all of which have the same pattern:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A header line which begins with a keyword and ends with a colon.</li>
<li>A <strong>body</strong> consisting of one or more Python statements, each indented the same amount — <em>the Python style guide recommends 4 spaces</em> — from the header line.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ve already seen the <code>for</code> loop which follows this pattern.</p>
<p>So looking again at the function definition, the keyword in the header is <code>def</code>, which is followed by the name of the function and some <em>parameters</em> enclosed in parentheses. The parameter list may be empty, or it may contain any number of parameters separated from one another by commas. In either case, the parentheses are required. The parameters specifies what information, if any, we have to provide in order to use the new function.</p>
<p>Suppose we’re working with turtles, and a common operation we need is to draw squares. “Draw a square” is an <em>abstraction</em>, or a mental chunk, of a number of smaller steps. So let’s write a function to capture the pattern of this “building block”:</p>
<p>Suppose we are writing a program to calculate the amount of tip due on a bill. We might write a function to “calculate tip”. “calculate tip” is an <em>abstraction</em>, or a mental chunk, of a number of smaller steps. So let’s write a function to capture the pattern of this “building block”:</p>

    tip = bill * (pct * .<span class="dv">01</span>) <span class="co"># convert pct to a decimal and calculate</span>
    tip = <span class="dt">round</span>(tip, <span class="dv">2</span>) <span class="co"># round the tip to 2 decimal places</span>

    <span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Tip percentage: &quot;</span> + <span class="dt">str</span>(pct) + <span class="st">&quot;%&quot;</span>)
    <span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Tip amount due: $&quot;</span> + <span class="dt">str</span>(total))

<span class="co"># find the amount of an 18% tip on a $100 bill</span>
calculate_tip(<span class="dv">100</span>,<span class="dv">18</span>)</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<aside id="docstrings">
<p><strong>Docstrings for documentation</strong></p>
<p>If the first thing after the function header is a string, it is treated as a <strong>docstring</strong> and gets special treatment in Python and in some programming tools. For example, when we type a built-in function name with an unclosed parenthesis in PyScripter, a tooltip pops up, telling us what arguments the function takes, and it shows us any other text contained in the docstring.</p>
<p>Docstrings are the key way to document our functions in Python and the documentation part is important. Because whoever calls our function shouldn’t have to need to know what is going on in the function or how it works; they just need to know what arguments our function takes, what it does, and what the expected result is. Enough to be able to use the function without having to look underneath. This goes back to the concept of abstraction of which we’ll talk more about.</p>
<p>Docstrings are usually formed using triple-quoted strings as they allow us to easily expand the docstring later on should we want to write more than a one-liner.</p>
Just to differentiate from comments, a string at the start of a function (a docstring) is retrievable by Python tools <em>at runtime</em>. By contrast, comments are completely eliminated when the program is parsed.
</aside>

<p>This function is named <code>calculate_tip</code>. It has two parameters: one to tell the function the amount of the bill, and the other to tell it the percent tip to calculate. Make sure you know where the body of the function ends — it depends on the indentation, and the blank lines don’t count for this purpose!</p>
<p>Defining a new function does not make the function run. To do that we need a <strong>function call</strong>. We’ve already seen how to call some built-in functions like <strong>print</strong>, <strong>range</strong>, <strong>round</strong>, and <strong>int</strong>. Function calls contain the name of the function being executed followed by a list of values, called <em>arguments</em>, which are assigned to the parameters in the function definition. So in the last line of the example program above, we call the function, and pass <code>100</code> as the amount of the bill and <code>18</code> as the percentage of the tip. While the function is executing, then, the variable <code>bill</code> refers to the value 100, and the variable <code>pct</code> refers to 18.</p>
<p>Once we’ve defined a function, we can call it as often as we like, and its statements will be executed each time we call it. And we could use it to get any of our turtles to draw a square. In the next example, we calculate 3 different tip amounts for the same bill.</p>

<h2><a href="#composition-functions-can-call-other-functions"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Composition: Functions can call other functions</a></h2>
<p>So far, we have looked at the elements of a program—<code>variables</code>, <code>expressions</code>, and <code>statements</code>—in isolation, without talking about how to combine them.</p>
<p>One of the most useful features of programming languages is their ability to take small building blocks and <strong>compose</strong> them. In our calculate_tip example, we call several Python built-in functions: <code>round</code> to keep our amounts to 2 decimal places and <code>str</code> to convert numeric data (ints and floats) to strings when we print them. As we will see, we can compose our programs of many functions that we define ourselves.</p>
<p>There are some points worth noting here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions can call other functions.</li>
<li>A caller of this function might say <code>calculate_tip(myBill, 15)</code>. The parameters of this function, <code>bill</code> and <code>tip</code>, are assigned the values of the myBill variable, and the int literal 15, respectively.</li>
<li>In the body of the function they are just like any other variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, it may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to create all of these new functions. Actually, there are a lot of reasons, but this example demonstrates two:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Creating a new function gives us an opportunity to name a group of statements. Functions can simplify a program by hiding a complex computation behind a single command. The function (including its name) can capture our mental chunking, or <em>abstraction</em>, of the problem.<br /></li>
<li>Creating a new function can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we might expect, we have to create a function before we can execute it. In other words, the function definition has to be executed before the function is called.</p>

<section id="flow-of-execution" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#flow-of-execution"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Flow of execution</a></h2>
<p>In order to ensure that a function is defined before its first use, we have to know the order in which statements are executed, which is called the <strong>flow of execution</strong>.</p>
<p>Execution always begins at the first statement of the program. Statements are executed one at a time, in order from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside the function are not executed until the function is called. Although it is not common, we can define one function inside another. In this case, the inner definition isn’t executed until the outer function is called.</p>
<p>Function calls are like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the first line of the called function, executes all the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.</p>
<p>That sounds simple enough, until we remember that one function can call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to execute the statements in another function. But while executing that new function, the program might have to execute yet another function!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Python is adept at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function completes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that called it. When it gets to the end of the program, it terminates.</p>
<p>What’s the moral of this sordid tale? When we read a program, don’t read from top to bottom. Instead, follow the flow of execution.</p>
</section>
<section id="functions-that-require-arguments" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#functions-that-require-arguments"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Functions that require arguments</a></h2>
<p>Most functions require arguments: the arguments provide for generalization. For example, if we want to find the absolute value of a number, we have to indicate what the number is. Python has a built-in function for computing the absolute value:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="dt">abs</span>(<span class="dv">5</span>)
<span class="dv">5</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="dt">abs</span>(-<span class="dv">5</span>)
<span class="dv">5</span></code></pre>
<p>In this example, the arguments to the <code>abs</code> function are 5 and -5.</p>
<p>Some functions take more than one argument. For example the built-in function <code>round</code> takes two arguments, the number to round and the (optional) number of decimal digits of precision. Inside the function, the values that are passed get assigned to variables called <strong>parameters</strong>.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="dt">round</span>(<span class="fl">3.14159</span>)
<span class="dv">3</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="dt">round</span>(<span class="fl">3.14159</span>,<span class="dv">3</span>)
<span class="fl">3.142</span></code></pre>
<p>Another built-in function that takes more than one argument is <code>max</code>.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="dt">max</span>(<span class="dv">7</span>, <span class="dv">11</span>)
<span class="dv">11</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="dt">max</span>(<span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">17</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">12</span>)
<span class="dv">17</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="dt">max</span>(<span class="dv">3</span> * <span class="dv">11</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>**<span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">512</span> - <span class="dv">9</span>, <span class="dv">1024</span>**<span class="dv">0</span>)
<span class="dv">503</span></code></pre>
<p><code>max</code> can be passed any number of arguments, separated by commas, and will return the largest value passed. The arguments can be either simple values or expressions. In the last example, 503 is returned, since it is larger than 33, 125, and 1.</p>
</section>
<section id="functions-that-return-values" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#functions-that-return-values"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Functions that return values</a></h2>
<p>All the functions in the previous section return values. Furthermore, functions like <code>range</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>abs</code> all return values that can be used to build more complex expressions.</p>
<p>So an important difference between these functions and one like <code>calculate_tip</code> is that <code>calculate_tip</code> does not return a useful value — it computes a value and displays the results on the screen.</p>
<p>A function that returns a value is called a <strong>fruitful function</strong> in this book. The opposite of a fruitful function is <strong>void function</strong> — one that is not executed for its resulting value, but is executed because it does something useful. (Languages like Java, C#, C and C++ use the term “void function”, other languages like Pascal call it a <strong>procedure</strong>.) Even though void functions are not executed for their resulting value, Python always wants to return something. So if the programmer doesn’t arrange to return a value, Python will automatically return the value <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>How do we write our own fruitful function? Let’s look at the standard formula for compound interest as an example fo a fruitful function:</p>
<figure>

<span class="co">   &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
   
   a = p * (<span class="dv">1</span> + r/n) ** (n*t)
   <span class="kw">return</span> a         <span class="co"># This is new, and makes the function fruitful.</span>
             
<span class="co"># now that we have the function above, let us call it.  </span>
toInvest = <span class="dt">float</span>(<span class="dt">input</span>(<span class="st">&quot;How much do you want to invest?&quot;</span>))
fnl = final_amt(toInvest, <span class="fl">0.08</span>, <span class="dv">12</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>)
<span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;At the end of the period you&#39;ll have&quot;</span>, fnl)</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>return</strong> statement is followed an expression (<code>a</code> in this case). This expression will be evaluated and returned to the caller as the “fruit” of calling this function.</li>
<li>We prompted the user for the principal amount. The type of <code>toInvest</code> is a string, but we need a number before we can work with it. Because it is money, and could have decimal places, we’ve used the <code>float</code> type converter function to parse the string and return a float.</li>
<li>Notice how we entered the arguments for 8% interest, compounded 12 times per year, for 5 years.</li>
<li><p>When we run this, we get the output</p>
<p><em>At the end of the period you’ll have 14898.457083</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a bit messy with all these decimal places, but remember that Python doesn’t understand that we’re working with money: it just does the calculation to the best of its ability, without rounding. Later we’ll see how to format the string that is printed in such a way that it does get nicely rounded to two decimal places before printing. * The line <code>toInvest = float(input(&quot;How much do you want to invest?&quot;))</code> also shows yet another example of <em>composition</em> — we can call a function like <code>float</code>, and its arguments can be the results of other function calls (like <code>input</code>) that we’ve called along the way.</p>
<p>Notice something else very important here. The name of the variable we pass as an argument — <code>toInvest</code> — has nothing to do with the name of the parameter — <code>p</code>. It is as if <code>p = toInvest</code> is executed when <code>final_amt</code> is called. It doesn’t matter what the value was named in the caller, in <code>final_amt</code> its name is <code>p</code>.</p>
<p>These short variable names are getting quite tricky, so perhaps we’d prefer one of these versions instead:</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.python} :linenos:</p>
<pre><code>   def final_amt_v2(principalAmount, nominalPercentageRate, 
                                       numTimesPerYear, years):
       a = principalAmount * (1 + nominalPercentageRate / 
                            numTimesPerYear) ** (numTimesPerYear*years)
       return a
       
   def final_amt_v3(amt, rate, compounded, years):
       a = amt * (1 + rate/compounded) ** (componded*years)
       return a                  </code></pre>
<p>They all do the same thing. Use your judgement to write code that can be best understood by other humans!<br />Short variable names are more economical and sometimes make code easier to read: E = mc :sup:<code>2</code> would not be nearly so memorable if Einstein had used longer variable names! If you do prefer short names, make sure you also have some comments to enlighten the reader about what the variables are used for.</p>
<p>.. index:: single: local variable single: variable; local single: lifetime</p>
<p>Variables and parameters are local ———————————-</p>
<p>When we create a <strong>local variable</strong> inside a function, it only exists inside the function, and we cannot use it outside. For example, consider again this function:</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.python} :linenos:</p>
<pre><code>   def final_amt(p, r, n, t):
       a = p * (1 + r/n) ** (n*t)
       return a           </code></pre>
<p>If we try to use <code>a</code>, outside the function, we’ll get an error:</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.python}</p>
<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; a
    NameError: name &#39;a&#39; is not defined</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>a</code> is local to <code>final_amt</code>, and is not visible outside the function.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>a</code> only exists while the function is being executed — we call this its <strong>lifetime</strong>. When the execution of the function terminates, the local variables are destroyed.</p>
<p>Parameters are also local, and act like local variables. For example, the lifetimes of <code>p</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>n</code>, <code>t</code> begin when <code>final_amt</code> is called, and the lifetime ends when the function completes its execution.</p>
<p>So it is not possible for a function to set some local variable to a value, complete its execution, and then when it is called again next time, recover the local variable. Each call of the function creates new local variables, and their lifetimes expire when the function returns to the caller.</p>
<p>.. index:: refactoring code, chunking</p>
<p>Turtles Revisited —————–</p>
<p>Now that we have fruitful functions, we can focus our attention on reorganizing our code so that it fits more nicely into our mental chunks.<br />This process of rearrangement is called <strong>refactoring</strong> the code.</p>
<p>Two things we’re always going to want to do when working with turtles is to create the window for the turtle, and to create one or more turtles. We could write some functions to make these tasks easier in future:</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.python} :linenos:</p>
<pre><code>   def make_window(colr, ttle):   
       &quot;&quot;&quot;
         Set up the window with the given background color and title. 
         Returns the new window.
       &quot;&quot;&quot;
       w = turtle.Screen()             
       w.bgcolor(colr)
       w.title(ttle)
       return w
       
       
   def make_turtle(colr, sz):      
       &quot;&quot;&quot;
         Set up a turtle with the given color and pensize.
         Returns the new turtle.
       &quot;&quot;&quot;
       t = turtle.Turtle()
       t.color(colr)
       t.pensize(sz)
       return t


   wn = make_window(&quot;lightgreen&quot;, &quot;Tess and Alex dancing&quot;)
   tess = make_turtle(&quot;hotpink&quot;, 5)
   alex = make_turtle(&quot;black&quot;, 1)
   dave = make_turtle(&quot;yellow&quot;, 2)  </code></pre>
<p>The trick about refactoring code is to anticipate which things we are likely to want to change each time we call the function: these should become the parameters, or changeable parts, of the functions we write.</p>
<p>Glossary ——–</p>
<p>.. glossary::</p>
<pre><code>argument
    A value provided to a function when the function is called. This value
    is assigned to the corresponding parameter in the function.  The argument
    can be the result of an expression which may involve operators, 
    operands and calls to other fruitful functions.

body
    The second part of a compound statement. The body consists of a
    sequence of statements all indented the same amount from the beginning
    of the header.  The standard amount of indentation used within the
    Python community is 4 spaces.

compound statement
    A statement that consists of two parts:

    #. header - which begins with a keyword determining the statement
       type, and ends with a colon.
    #. body - containing one or more statements indented the same amount
       from the header.

    The syntax of a compound statement looks like this:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.python}
        
            keyword ... :
                statement
                statement ...
                                           
docstring
    A special string that is attached to a function as its ``__doc__`` attribute.
    Tools like PyScripter can use docstrings to provide documentation or hints for the programmer.
    When we get to modules, classes, and methods, we&#39;ll see that docstrings can also be used there. 

flow of execution
    The order in which statements are executed during a program run.

frame
    A box in a stack diagram that represents a function call. It contains
    the local variables and parameters of the function.

function
    A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation.
    Functions may or may not take parameters and may or may not produce a
    result.

function call
    A statement that executes a function. It consists of the name of the
    function followed by a list of arguments enclosed in parentheses.

function composition
    Using the output from one function call as the input to another.

function definition
    A statement that creates a new function, specifying its name,
    parameters, and the statements it executes.
    
fruitful function
    A function that returns a value when it is called.

header line
    The first part of a compound statement. A header line begins with a keyword and
    ends with a colon (:)

import statement
    A statement which permits functions and variables defined in another Python
    module to be brought into the environment of another script.  To use the 
    features of the turtle, we need to first import the turtle module.
    
lifetime
    Variables and objects have lifetimes — they are created at some point during
    program execution, and will be destroyed at some time. 
    
local variable
    A variable defined inside a function. A local variable can only be used
    inside its function.  Parameters of a function are also a special kind
    of local variable.

parameter
    A name used inside a function to refer to the value which was passed 
    to it as an argument.
       
refactor
    A fancy word to describe reorganizing our program code, usually to make 
    it more understandable.  Typically, we have a program that is already working,
    then we go back to &quot;tidy it up&quot;.  It often involves choosing better variable
    names, or spotting repeated patterns and moving that code into a function.    
    
stack diagram
    A graphical representation of a stack of functions, their variables,
    and the values to which they refer.

traceback
    A list of the functions that are executing, printed when a runtime
    error occurs. A traceback is also commonly refered to as a
    *stack trace*, since it lists the functions in the order in which they
    are stored in the
    `runtime stack &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_stack&gt;`__.
    
void function
    The opposite of a fruitful function: one that does not return a value.  It is
    executed for the work it does, rather than for the value it returns.</code></pre>

<p>.. image:: illustrations/nested_squares.png</p></li>
<li><p>Write a void function <code>draw_poly(t, n, sz)</code> which makes a turtle draw a regular polygon. When called with <code>draw_poly(tess, 8, 50)</code>, it will draw a shape like this:</p>

<li><p>The two spirals in this picture differ only by the turn angle. Draw both.</p>
<p>.. image:: illustrations/tess_spirals.png :height: 240</p></li>
<li><p>Write a void function <code>draw_equitriangle(t, sz)</code> which calls <code>draw_poly</code> from the previous question to have its turtle draw a equilateral triangle.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a fruitful function <code>sum_to(n)</code> that returns the sum of all integer numbers up to and including <code>n</code>. So <code>sum_to(10)</code> would be <code>1+2+3...+10</code> which would return the value 55.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a function <code>area_of_circle(r)</code> which returns the area of a circle of radius <code>r</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a void function to draw a star, where the length of each side is 100 units. (Hint: You should turn the turtle by 144 degrees at each point.)</p>
<p>.. image:: illustrations/star.png</p></li>
<li><p>Extend your program above. Draw five stars, but between each, pick up the pen, move forward by 350 units, turn right by 144, put the pen down, and draw the next star. You’ll get something like this:</p>
