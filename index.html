<h1><a href="#foreword"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Foreword</a></h1>
<p>By David Beazley</p>
<p>As an educator, researcher, and book author, I am delighted to see the completion of this book. Python is a fun and extremely easy-to-use programming language that has steadily gained in popularity over the last few years. Developed over ten years ago by Guido van Rossum, Python’s simple syntax and overall feel is largely derived from ABC, a teaching language that was developed in the 1980’s. However, Python was also created to solve real problems and it borrows a wide variety of features from programming languages such as C++, Java, Modula-3, and Scheme. Because of this, one of Python’s most remarkable features is its broad appeal to professional software developers, scientists, researchers, artists, and educators.</p>
<p>Despite Python’s appeal to many different communities, you may still wonder why Python? or why teach programming with Python? Answering these questions is no simple task—especially when popular opinion is on the side of more masochistic alternatives such as C++ and Java. However, I think the most direct answer is that programming in Python is simply a lot of fun and more productive.</p>
<p>When I teach computer science courses, I want to cover important concepts in addition to making the material interesting and engaging to students. Unfortunately, there is a tendency for introductory programming courses to focus far too much attention on mathematical abstraction and for students to become frustrated with annoying problems related to low-level details of syntax, compilation, and the enforcement of seemingly arcane rules. Although such abstraction and formalism is important to professional software engineers and students who plan to continue their study of computer science, taking such an approach in an introductory course mostly succeeds in making computer science boring. When I teach a course, I don’t want to have a room of uninspired students. I would much rather see them trying to solve interesting problems by exploring different ideas, taking unconventional approaches, breaking the rules, and learning from their mistakes. In doing so, I don’t want to waste half of the semester trying to sort out obscure syntax problems, unintelligible compiler error messages, or the several hundred ways that a program might generate a general protection fault.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why I like Python is that it provides a really nice balance between the practical and the conceptual. Since Python is interpreted, beginners can pick up the language and start doing neat things almost immediately without getting lost in the problems of compilation and linking. Furthermore, Python comes with a large library of modules that can be used to do all sorts of tasks ranging from web-programming to graphics. Having such a practical focus is a great way to engage students and it allows them to complete significant projects. However, Python can also serve as an excellent foundation for introducing important computer science concepts. Since Python fully supports procedures and classes, students can be gradually introduced to topics such as procedural abstraction, data structures, and object-oriented programming — all of which are applicable to later courses on Java or C++. Python even borrows a number of features from functional programming languages and can be used to introduce concepts that would be covered in more detail in courses on Scheme and Lisp.</p>
<p>In reading Jeffrey’s preface, I am struck by his comments that Python allowed him to see a higher level of success and a lower level of frustration and that he was able to move faster with better results. Although these comments refer to his introductory course, I sometimes use Python for these exact same reasons in advanced graduate level computer science courses at the University of Chicago. In these courses, I am constantly faced with the daunting task of covering a lot of difficult course material in a blistering nine week quarter. Although it is certainly possible for me to inflict a lot of pain and suffering by using a language like C++, I have often found this approach to be counterproductive—especially when the course is about a topic unrelated to just programming. I find that using Python allows me to better focus on the actual topic at hand while allowing students to complete substantial class projects.</p>
<p>Although Python is still a young and evolving language, I believe that it has a bright future in education. This book is an important step in that direction. David Beazley University of Chicago Author of the <em>Python Essential Reference</em></p>

<h1><a href="#preface"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Preface</a></h1>
<p>By Jeffrey Elkner</p>
<p>This book owes its existence to the collaboration made possible by the Internet and the free software movement. Its three authors—a college professor, a high school teacher, and a professional programmer—never met face to face to work on it, but we have been able to collaborate closely, aided by many other folks who have taken the time and energy to send us their feedback.</p>
<p>We think this book is a testament to the benefits and future possibilities of this kind of collaboration, the framework for which has been put in place by Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<section class="level2" id="how-and-why-i-came-to-use-python">
<h2><a href="#how-and-why-i-came-to-use-python"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> How and why I came to use Python</a></h2>
<p>In 1999, the College Board’s Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science exam was given in C++ for the first time. As in many high schools throughout the country, the decision to change languages had a direct impact on the computer science curriculum at Yorktown High School in Arlington, Virginia, where I teach. Up to this point, Pascal was the language of instruction in both our first-year and AP courses. In keeping with past practice of giving students two years of exposure to the same language, we made the decision to switch to C++ in the first year course for the 1997-98 school year so that we would be in step with the College Board’s change for the AP course the following year.</p>
<p>Two years later, I was convinced that C++ was a poor choice to use for introducing students to computer science. While it is certainly a very powerful programming language, it is also an extremely difficult language to learn and teach. I found myself constantly fighting with C++’s difficult syntax and multiple ways of doing things, and I was losing many students unnecessarily as a result. Convinced there had to be a better language choice for our first-year class, I went looking for an alternative to C++.</p>
<p>I needed a language that would run on the machines in our GNU/Linux lab as well as on the Windows and Macintosh platforms most students have at home. I wanted it to be free software, so that students could use it at home regardless of their income. I wanted a language that was used by professional programmers, and one that had an active developer community around it. It had to support both procedural and object-oriented programming. And most importantly, it had to be easy to learn and teach. When I investigated the choices with these goals in mind, Python stood out as the best candidate for the job.</p>
<p>I asked one of Yorktown’s talented students, Matt Ahrens, to give Python a try. In two months he not only learned the language but wrote an application called pyTicket that enabled our staff to report technology problems via the Web. I knew that Matt could not have finished an application of that scale in so short a time in C++, and this accomplishment, combined with Matt’s positive assessment of Python, suggested that Python was the solution I was looking for.</p>

<section class="level2" id="finding-a-textbook">
<h2><a href="#finding-a-textbook"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Finding a textbook</a></h2>
<p>Having decided to use Python in both of my introductory computer science classes the following year, the most pressing problem was the lack of an available textbook.</p>
<p>Free documents came to the rescue. Earlier in the year, Richard Stallman had introduced me to Allen Downey. Both of us had written to Richard expressing an interest in developing free educational materials. Allen had already written a first-year computer science textbook, <em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em>. When I read this book, I knew immediately that I wanted to use it in my class. It was the clearest and most helpful computer science text I had seen. It emphasized the processes of thought involved in programming rather than the features of a particular language. Reading it immediately made me a better teacher.</p>
<p><em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em> was not just an excellent book, but it had been released under the GNU public license, which meant it could be used freely and modified to meet the needs of its user. Once I decided to use Python, it occurred to me that I could translate Allen’s original Java version of the book into the new language. While I would not have been able to write a textbook on my own, having Allen’s book to work from made it possible for me to do so, at the same time demonstrating that the cooperative development model used so well in software could also work for educational materials.</p>
<p>Working on this book for the last two years has been rewarding for both my students and me, and my students played a big part in the process. Since I could make instant changes whenever someone found a spelling error or difficult passage, I encouraged them to look for mistakes in the book by giving them a bonus point each time they made a suggestion that resulted in a change in the text. This had the double benefit of encouraging them to read the text more carefully and of getting the text thoroughly reviewed by its most important critics, students using it to learn computer science.</p>
<p>For the second half of the book on object-oriented programming, I knew that someone with more real programming experience than I had would be needed to do it right. The book sat in an unfinished state for the better part of a year until the open source community once again provided the needed means for its completion.</p>
<p>I received an email from Chris Meyers expressing interest in the book. Chris is a professional programmer who started teaching a programming course last year using Python at Lane Community College in Eugene, Oregon. The prospect of teaching the course had led Chris to the book, and he started helping out with it immediately. By the end of the school year he had created a companion project on our Website at <a href="http://openbookproject.net">http://openbookproject.net</a> (<em>Python for Fun</em>)[http://openbookproject.net/py4fun&gt;] and was working with some of my most advanced students as a master teacher, guiding them beyond where I could take them.</p>

<section class="level2" id="introducing-programming-with-python">
<h2><a href="#introducing-programming-with-python"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Introducing programming with Python</a></h2>
<p>The process of translating and using <em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em> for the past two years has confirmed Python’s suitability for teaching beginning students. Python greatly simplifies programming examples and makes important programming ideas easier to teach.</p>
<p>The first example from the text illustrates this point. It is the traditional hello, world program, which in the Java version of the book looks like this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span class="kw">class</span> Hello
{
    <span class="kw">public</span> <span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">void</span> <span class="fu">main</span> (String[] args)
    {
        System.<span class="fu">out</span>.<span class="fu">println</span> (<span class="st">&quot;Hello, world.&quot;</span>);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>in the Python version it becomes:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>)</code></pre>
<p>Even though this is a trivial example, the advantages of Python stand out. Yorktown’s Computer Science I course has no prerequisites, so many of the students seeing this example are looking at their first program. Some of them are undoubtedly a little nervous, having heard that computer programming is difficult to learn. The Java version has always forced me to choose between two unsatisfying options: either to explain the <code>class Hello</code>, <code>public static void main</code>, <code>String[] args</code>, <code>{</code>, and <code>}</code>, statements and risk confusing or intimidating some of the students right at the start, or to tell them, Just don’t worry about all of that stuff now; we will talk about it later, and risk the same thing. The educational objectives at this point in the course are to introduce students to the idea of a programming statement and to get them to write their first program, thereby introducing them to the programming environment. The Python program has exactly what is needed to do these things, and nothing more.</p>
<p>Comparing the explanatory text of the program in each version of the book further illustrates what this means to the beginning student. There are seven paragraphs of explanation of Hello, world! in the Java version; in the Python version, there are only a few sentences. More importantly, the missing six paragraphs do not deal with the big ideas in computer programming but with the minutia of Java syntax. I found this same thing happening throughout the book. Whole paragraphs simply disappear from the Python version of the text because Python’s much clearer syntax renders them unnecessary.</p>
<p>Using a very high-level language like Python allows a teacher to postpone talking about low-level details of the machine until students have the background that they need to better make sense of the details. It thus creates the ability to put first things first pedagogically. One of the best examples of this is the way in which Python handles variables. In Java a variable is a name for a place that holds a value if it is a built-in type, and a reference to an object if it is not. Explaining this distinction requires a discussion of how the computer stores data. Thus, the idea of a variable is bound up with the hardware of the machine. The powerful and fundamental concept of a variable is already difficult enough for beginning students (in both computer science and algebra). Bytes and addresses do not help the matter. In Python a variable is a name that refers to a thing. This is a far more intuitive concept for beginning students and is much closer to the meaning of variable that they learned in their math courses. I had much less difficulty teaching variables this year than I did in the past, and I spent less time helping students with problems using them.</p>
<p>Another example of how Python aids in the teaching and learning of programming is in its syntax for functions. My students have always had a great deal of difficulty understanding functions. The main problem centers around the difference between a function definition and a function call, and the related distinction between a parameter and an argument. Python comes to the rescue with syntax that is nothing short of beautiful. Function definitions begin with the keyword <code>def</code>, so I simply tell my students, When you define a function, begin with <code>def</code>, followed by the name of the function that you are defining; when you call a function, simply call (type) out its name. Parameters go with definitions; arguments go with calls. There are no return types, parameter types, or reference and value parameters to get in the way, so I am now able to teach functions in less than half the time that it previously took me, with better comprehension.</p>
<p>Using Python improved the effectiveness of our computer science program for all students. I saw a higher general level of success and a lower level of frustration than I experienced teaching with either C++ or Java. I moved faster with better results. More students left the course with the ability to create meaningful programs and with the positive attitude toward the experience of programming that this engenders.</p>

<p>By Peter Wentworth</p>

<p><strong>A word of thanks …</strong></p>
<p>We switched from Java to Python in our introductory courses in 2010. So far we think the results look positive. More time will tell.</p>
<p>This predecessor to this book was a great starting point for us, especially because of the liberal permission to change things. Having our own in-house course notes or handouts allows us to adapt and stay fresh, rearrange, see what works, and it gives us agility. We can also ensure that every student in the course gets a copy of the handouts — something that doesn’t always happen if we prescribe costly textbooks.</p>
Many thanks to all the contributors and the authors for making their hard work available to the Python community and to our students.
</aside>

<p>A colleague and friend, Peter Warren, once made the remark that learning introductory programming is as much about the environment as it is about the programming language.</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).<br />I want help to be integrated into my editor, as a first-class citizen, available at the press of a button. I want syntax highlighting. I want immediate syntax checking, and sensible autocompletion. I’d like an editor that can fold function bodies or regions of code away, because it promotes and encourages how we build mental abstractions.</p>
<p>I’m especially keen on having a single-stepping debugger and breakpoints with code inspection built in. We’re trying to build a conceptual model of program execution in the student’s mind, so I find most helpful for teaching to have the call stack and variables explicitly visible, and to be able to immediately inspect the result of executing a statement.</p>
<p>My philosophy, then, is not to look for a language to teach, but to look for a combination of IDE and language that are packaged together, and evaluated as a whole.</p>
<p>I’ve made some quite deep changes to the original book to reflect this (and various other opinionated views that I hold), and I have no doubt that more changes will follow as we mature our course.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key things I’ve approached differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our local situation demands that we have a large number of service course students in an introductory course of just 3 weeks, and then we get another semester of teaching with those going into our mainstream program. So the book is in two parts: we’ll do the first five chapters in the big “get your toes wet” course, and the rest of the material in a separate semester.</li>
<li>We’re using Python 3. It is cleaner, more object oriented, and has fewer ad-hoc irregularities than earlier versions of Python.</li>
<li>We’re using PyScripter as our IDE, on Windows. And it is hardwired into parts of these notes, with screenshots, etc.</li>
<li>I’ve dropped GASP.</li>
<li>For graphics we start with the Turtle module.<br /> As things move along, we use PyGame for more advanced graphics.</li>
<li>I’ve introduced some event-driven programming using the turtle.<br /></li>
<li>I have tried to push more object-oriented notions earlier, without asking students to synthesize objects or write their own classes. So, for example, in the chapter about the turtle, we create multiple instances of turtles, talk about their attributes and state (color, position, etc), and we favour method-call style to move them around, i.e. <code>tess.forward(100)</code>. Similarly, when we use random numbers, we avoid the “hidden singleton generator” in the random module — we prefer to create an instance of a generator, and invoke methods on the instance.</li>
<li>The ease of constructing lists and the <code>for</code> loop seem to be winners in Python, so rather than use the traditional command-line <code>input</code> for data, I’ve favoured using loops and lists right up front, like this:</li>
</ul>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python">friends = [<span class="st">&quot;Zoe&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Joe&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Bill&quot;</span>]
<span class="kw">for</span> f in friends:
    invitation = <span class="st">&quot;Hi &quot;</span> + f + <span class="st">&quot;.  Please come to my party on Saturday!&quot;</span>
    <span class="kw">print</span>(invitation)</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>This also means that I bumped <code>range</code> up for early exposure.<br />I envisage that over time we’ll see more opportunities to exploit “early lists, early iteration” in its most simple form.</p>
<ul>
<li>I dumped <code>doctest</code>: it is too quirky for my liking. For example, it fails a test if the spacing between list elements is not precisely the same as the output string, or if Python prints a string with single quotes, but you wrote up the test case with double quotes. Cases like this also confused students (and instructors) quite badly:</li>
</ul>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python">
<span class="kw">def</span> addlist(xs):
    <span class="co">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="co">    &gt;&gt;&gt; xs = [2,3,4]</span>
<span class="co">    &gt;&gt;&gt; addlist(xs)</span>
<span class="co">    9</span>
<span class="co">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="kw">return</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>If you can explain the difference in scope rules and lifetimes between the parameter <code>xs</code> and the doctest variable <code>xs</code> elegantly, please let me know. Yes, I know doctest creates its own scope behind our back, but it is exactly this black magic that we’re trying to avoid.<br />From the usual indentation rules, also looks like the doctests are nested inside the function scope, but they are not. Students thought that the parameter had been given its value by the assignment to <code>xs</code> in the doctest!</p>
<p>I also think that keeping the test suite separate from the functions under test leads to a cleaner relationship between caller and callee, and gives a better chance of getting argument passing / parameter concepts taught accurately.</p>
<p>There is a good unit testing module in Python, (and PyScripter offers integrated support for it, and automated generation of skeleton test modules), but it looked too advanced for beginners, because it requires multi-module concepts.</p>
<p>So I’ve favoured my own test scaffolding in Chapter 6 (about 10 lines of code) that the students must insert into whatever file they’re working on.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I’ve played down command-line input / process / output where possible. Many of our students have never seen a command-line shell, and it is arguably quite intimidating.</p></li>
<li><p>We’ve gone back to a more “classic / static” approach to writing our own classes and objects. Python (in company with languages like Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, etc.) don’t really emphasize notions of “sealed” classes or “private” members, or even “sealed instances”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So one teaching approach is to allocate each instance as an empty container, and subsequently allow the external clients of the class to poke new members (methods or attributes) into different instances as they wish to.<br /> It is a very dynamic approach, but perhaps not one that encourages thinking in abstractions, layers, contracts, decoupling, etc. It might even be the kind of thing that one could write one of those <em>“x,y,z … considered harmful”</em> papers about.</p>
<p>In our more conservative approach, we put an initializer into every class, we determine at object instantiation time what members we want, and we initialize the instances from within the class. So we’ve moved closer in philosophy to C# / Java on this one.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We’re moving towards introducing more algorithms earlier into the course. Python is an efficient teaching language — we can make fast progress. But the gains we make there we’d like to invest into deeper problem solving, and more complex algorithms with the basics, rather than cover “more Python features”. Some of these changes have started to find their way in this version, and I’m sure we’ll see more in future.</p></li>
<li><p>We’re interested in issues around teaching and learning. Some research indicates that “intellectual playfulness” is important. The study referenced in the Odds-and-ends workbook at the end just didn’t seem to have anywhere sensible to go in the book, yet I wanted it included. It is quite likely that we’ll allow more issues like this to creep into the book, to try to make it more than just about programming in Python.</p></li>
</ul>

<section class="level2" id="functions-1">
<h2><a href="#functions-1"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Functions</a></h2>
<p>In Python, a <strong>function</strong> is a named sequence of statements that belong together. Their primary purpose is to help us organize programs into chunks that match how we think about the problem.</p>
<p>The syntax for a <strong>function definition</strong> is:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> NAME( PARAMETERS ):
    STATEMENTS</code></pre>
<p>We can make up any names we want for the functions we create, except that we can’t use a name that is a Python keyword, and the names must follow the rules for legal identifiers.</p>
<p>There can be any number of statements inside the function, but they have to be indented from the <code>def</code>. In the examples in this book, we will use the standard indentation of four spaces. Function definitions are the second of several <strong>compound statements</strong> we will see, all of which have the same pattern:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A header line which begins with a keyword and ends with a colon.</li>
<li>A <strong>body</strong> consisting of one or more Python statements, each indented the same amount — <em>the Python style guide recommends 4 spaces</em> — from the header line.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ve already seen the <code>for</code> loop which follows this pattern.</p>
<p>So looking again at the function definition, the keyword in the header is <code>def</code>, which is followed by the name of the function and some <em>parameters</em> enclosed in parentheses. The parameter list may be empty, or it may contain any number of parameters separated from one another by commas. In either case, the parentheses are required. The parameters specifies what information, if any, we have to provide in order to use the new function.</p>
<p>Suppose we’re working with turtles, and a common operation we need is to draw squares. “Draw a square” is an <em>abstraction</em>, or a mental chunk, of a number of smaller steps. So let’s write a function to capture the pattern of this “building block”:</p>
<p>Suppose we are writing a program to calculate the amount of tip due on a bill. We might write a function to “calculate tip”. “calculate tip” is an <em>abstraction</em>, or a mental chunk, of a number of smaller steps. So let’s write a function to capture the pattern of this “building block”:</p>

<span class="co"># find the amount of an 18% tip on a $100 bill</span>
calculate_tip(<span class="dv">100</span>,<span class="dv">18</span>)</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<aside id="docstrings">
<p><strong>Docstrings for documentation</strong></p>
<p>If the first thing after the function header is a string, it is treated as a <strong>docstring</strong> and gets special treatment in Python and in some programming tools. For example, when we type a built-in function name with an unclosed parenthesis in PyScripter, a tooltip pops up, telling us what arguments the function takes, and it shows us any other text contained in the docstring.</p>
<p>Docstrings are the key way to document our functions in Python and the documentation part is important. Because whoever calls our function shouldn’t have to need to know what is going on in the function or how it works; they just need to know what arguments our function takes, what it does, and what the expected result is. Enough to be able to use the function without having to look underneath. This goes back to the concept of abstraction of which we’ll talk more about.</p>
<p>Docstrings are usually formed using triple-quoted strings as they allow us to easily expand the docstring later on should we want to write more than a one-liner.</p>
Just to differentiate from comments, a string at the start of a function (a docstring) is retrievable by Python tools <em>at runtime</em>. By contrast, comments are completely eliminated when the program is parsed.
</aside>

<p>This function is named <code>calculate_tip</code>. It has two parameters: one to tell the function the amount of the bill, and the other to tell it the percent tip to calculate. Make sure you know where the body of the function ends — it depends on the indentation, and the blank lines don’t count for this purpose!</p>
<p>Defining a new function does not make the function run. To do that we need a <strong>function call</strong>. We’ve already seen how to call some built-in functions like <strong>print</strong>, <strong>range</strong>, <strong>round</strong>, and <strong>int</strong>. Function calls contain the name of the function being executed followed by a list of values, called <em>arguments</em>, which are assigned to the parameters in the function definition. So in the last line of the example program above, we call the function, and pass <code>100</code> as the amount of the bill and <code>18</code> as the percentage of the tip. While the function is executing, then, the variable <code>bill</code> refers to the value 100, and the variable <code>pct</code> refers to 18.</p>
<p>Once we’ve defined a function, we can call it as often as we like, and its statements will be executed each time we call it. And we could use it to get any of our turtles to draw a square. In the next example, we calculate 3 different tip amounts for the same bill.</p>

<aside id="coding-style">

<p><strong>Coding Style</strong></p>
<p>Now that you are about to write longer, more complex pieces of Python, it is a good time to talk about coding style. Most languages can be written (or more concise, formatted) in different styles; some are more readable than others. Making it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps tremendously for that.</p>
<p>For Python, <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8 has emerged as the style guide</a> that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style. Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the most important points extracted for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.</li>
<li>4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.</li>
<li>Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.</li>
<li>This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.</li>
<li>Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.</li>
<li>When possible, put comments on a line of their own.</li>
<li>Use docstrings.</li>
<li>Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4).</li>
<li>Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use CamelCase for classes and lower_case_with_underscores for functions and methods. Always use self as the name for the first method argument (see A First Look at Classes for more on classes and methods).</li>
<li>Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case.</li>
<li>Likewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is only the slightest chance people speaking a different language will read or maintain the code.</li>

<section class="level2" id="composition-functions-can-call-other-functions">
<h2><a href="#composition-functions-can-call-other-functions"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Composition: Functions can call other functions</a></h2>
<p>So far, we have looked at the elements of a program—<code>variables</code>, <code>expressions</code>, and <code>statements</code>—in isolation, without talking about how to combine them.</p>
<p>One of the most useful features of programming languages is their ability to take small building blocks and <strong>compose</strong> them. In our calculate_tip example, we call several Python built-in functions: <code>round</code> to keep our amounts to 2 decimal places and <code>str</code> to convert numeric data (ints and floats) to strings when we print them. As we will see, we can compose our programs of many functions that we define ourselves.</p>
<p>There are some points worth noting here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions can call other functions.</li>
<li>A caller of this function might say <code>calculate_tip(myBill, 15)</code>. The parameters of this function, <code>bill</code> and <code>tip</code>, are assigned the values of the myBill variable, and the int literal 15, respectively.</li>
<li>In the body of the function they are just like any other variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, it may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to create all of these new functions. Actually, there are a lot of reasons, but this example demonstrates two:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Creating a new function gives us an opportunity to name a group of statements. Functions can simplify a program by hiding a complex computation behind a single command. The function (including its name) can capture our mental chunking, or <em>abstraction</em>, of the problem.<br /></li>
<li>Creating a new function can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we might expect, we have to create a function before we can execute it. In other words, the function definition has to be executed before the function is called.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="flow-of-execution">
<h2><a href="#flow-of-execution"><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Flow of execution</a></h2>
<p>In order to ensure that a function is defined before its first use, we have to know the order in which statements are executed, which is called the <strong>flow of execution</strong>.</p>
<p>Execution always begins at the first statement of the program. Statements are executed one at a time, in order from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside the function are not executed until the function is called. Although it is not common, we can define one function inside another. In this case, the inner definition isn’t executed until the outer function is called.</p>
<p>Function calls are like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the first line of the called function, executes all the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.</p>
<p>That sounds simple enough, until we remember that one function can call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to execute the statements in another function. But while executing that new function, the program might have to execute yet another function!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Python is adept at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function completes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that called it. When it gets to the end of the program, it terminates.</p>
<p>What’s the moral of this sordid tale? When we read a program, don’t read from top to bottom. Instead, follow the flow of execution.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="functions-that-require-arguments">
<h2><a href="#functions-that-require-arguments"><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Functions that require arguments</a></h2>
<p>Most functions require arguments: the arguments provide for generalization. For example, if we want to find the absolute value of a number, we have to indicate what the number is. Python has a built-in function for computing the absolute value:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="dt">abs</span>(<span class="dv">5</span>)
<span class="dv">5</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="dt">abs</span>(-<span class="dv">5</span>)
<span class="dv">5</span></code></pre>
<p>In this example, the arguments to the <code>abs</code> function are 5 and -5.</p>
<p>Some functions take more than one argument. For example the built-in function <code>round</code> takes two arguments, the number to round and the (optional) number of decimal digits of precision. Inside the function, the values that are passed get assigned to variables called <strong>parameters</strong>.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="dt">round</span>(<span class="fl">3.14159</span>)
<span class="dv">3</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="dt">round</span>(<span class="fl">3.14159</span>,<span class="dv">3</span>)

<section class="level2" id="functions-that-return-values">
<h2><a href="#functions-that-return-values"><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Functions that return values</a></h2>
<p>All the functions in the previous section return values. Furthermore, functions like <code>range</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>abs</code> all return values that can be used to build more complex expressions.</p>
<p>So an important difference between these functions and one like <code>calculate_tip</code> is that <code>calculate_tip</code> does not return a useful value — it computes a value and displays the results on the screen.</p>
<p>A function that returns a value is called a <strong>fruitful function</strong> in this book. The opposite of a fruitful function is <strong>void function</strong> — one that is not executed for its resulting value, but is executed because it does something useful. (Languages like Java, C#, C and C++ use the term “void function”, other languages like Pascal call it a <strong>procedure</strong>.) Even though void functions are not executed for their resulting value, Python always wants to return something. So if the programmer doesn’t arrange to return a value, Python will automatically return the value <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>How do we write our own fruitful function? Let’s look at the standard formula for compound interest as an example fo a fruitful function:</p>

   <span class="kw">return</span> a         <span class="co"># This is new, and makes the function fruitful.</span>

toInvest = <span class="dt">float</span>(<span class="dt">input</span>(<span class="st">&quot;How much do you want to invest?&quot;</span>))
fnl = final_amt(toInvest, <span class="fl">0.08</span>, <span class="dv">12</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>)
<span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;At the end of the period you&#39;ll have&quot;</span>, fnl)</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>return</strong> statement is followed an expression (<code>a</code> in this case). This expression will be evaluated and returned to the caller as the “fruit” of calling this function.</li>
<li>We prompted the user for the principal amount. The type of <code>toInvest</code> is a string, but we need a number before we can work with it. Because it is money, and could have decimal places, we’ve used the <code>float</code> type converter function to parse the string and return a float.</li>
<li>Notice how we entered the arguments for 8% interest, compounded 12 times per year, for 5 years.</li>
<li><p>When we run this, we get the output</p>
<p><em>At the end of the period you’ll have 14898.457083</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a bit messy with all these decimal places, but remember that Python doesn’t understand that we’re working with money: it just does the calculation to the best of its ability, without rounding. Later we’ll see how to format the string that is printed in such a way that it does get nicely rounded to two decimal places before printing. * The line <code>toInvest = float(input(&quot;How much do you want to invest?&quot;))</code> also shows yet another example of <em>composition</em> — we can call a function like <code>float</code>, and its arguments can be the results of other function calls (like <code>input</code>) that we’ve called along the way.</p>
<p>Notice something else very important here. The name of the variable we pass as an argument — <code>toInvest</code> — has nothing to do with the name of the parameter — <code>p</code>. It is as if <code>p = toInvest</code> is executed when <code>final_amt</code> is called. It doesn’t matter what the value was named in the caller, in <code>final_amt</code> its name is <code>p</code>.</p>
<p>These short variable names are getting quite tricky, so perhaps we’d prefer one of these versions instead:</p>

   a = amt * (<span class="dv">1</span> + rate/compounded) ** (componded*years)
   <span class="kw">return</span> a</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>They all do the same thing. Use your judgement to write code that can be best understood by other humans!<br />Short variable names are more economical and sometimes make code easier to read: E = mc<sup>2</sup> would not be nearly so memorable if Einstein had used longer variable names! If you do prefer short names, make sure you also have some comments to enlighten the reader about what the variables are used for.</p>
<hr />
<p>When we create a <strong>local variable</strong> inside a function, it only exists inside the function, and we cannot use it outside. For example, consider again this function:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> final_amt(p, r, n, t):
   a = p * (<span class="dv">1</span> + r/n) ** (n*t)
   <span class="kw">return</span> a           </code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>If we try to use <code>a</code>, outside the function, we’ll get an error:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; a
<span class="ot">NameError</span>: name <span class="st">&#39;a&#39;</span> is not defined</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>a</code> is local to <code>final_amt</code>, and is not visible outside the function.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>a</code> only exists while the function is being executed — we call this its <strong>lifetime</strong>. When the execution of the function terminates, the local variables are destroyed.</p>
<p>Parameters are also local, and act like local variables. For example, the lifetimes of <code>p</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>n</code>, <code>t</code> begin when <code>final_amt</code> is called, and the lifetime ends when the function completes its execution.</p>
<p>So it is not possible for a function to set some local variable to a value, complete its execution, and then when it is called again next time, recover the local variable. Each call of the function creates new local variables, and their lifetimes expire when the function returns to the caller.</p>

<h2><a href="#tips-revisited"><span class="header-section-number">5.6</span> Tips Revisited</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have fruitful functions, we can focus our attention on reorganizing our code so that it fits more nicely into our mental chunks.<br />This process of rearrangement is called <strong>refactoring</strong> the code.</p>
<p>Two things want to do in our tip calculator is to find the amount of the tip and show the results to the user. In the example below, we separate the various functions of the program to make a more complete tip calculator. As you’ll see, we’re starting to build code that is useful. Using functions allows us to make changes to one part of a program without affecting other parts of the program. For example, we can change the welcome message without worrying about breaking our calculations.</p>

<p>The trick about refactoring code is to anticipate which things we are likely to want to change each time we call the function: these should become the parameters, or changeable parts, of the functions we write.</p>
<aside id="main">
<p><strong>The <code>main</code> function</strong></p>
<p>In our code example above, we encounter Python’s special syntax for running a program from the command line:</p>

<p>This conditional statement allows the program to execute code if it is being run as a standalone Python program. In our case, we choose to call the <code>main</code> function which we defined. main() has no special meaning in Python, though, and we could execute any statements we choose under that block.</p>

<p>Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly.</p>
<p>Repeated execution of a set of statements is called <strong>iteration</strong>. Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it easier. The <code>for</code> loop is the form of iteration you’ll likely be using most often, and we will look at that first. But in this chapter we’ve going to look at the <code>while</code> statement — another way to have your program do iteration, useful in slightly different circumstances.</p>

<li>Lines 2 and 3 are the <strong>loop body</strong>. The loop body is always indented. The indentation determines exactly what statements are “in the body of the loop”.</li>
<li>On each <em>iteration</em> or <em>pass</em> of the loop, first a check is done to see if there are still more items to be processed. If there are none left (this is called the <strong>terminating condition</strong> of the loop), the loop has finished. Program execution continues at the next statement after the loop body, (e.g. in this case the next statement below the comment in line 4).<br /></li>
<li>If there are items still to be processed, the loop variable is updated to refer to the next item in the list. This means, in this case, that the loop body is executed here 7 times, and each time <code>f</code> will refer to a different friend.</li>
<li>At the end of each execution of the body of the loop, Python returns to the <code>for</code> statement, to see if there are more items to be handled, and to assign the next one to <code>f</code>.</li>

<h2><a href="#flow-of-execution-of-the-for-loop"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Flow of Execution of the for loop</a></h2>
<p>As a program executes, the interpreter always keeps track of which statement is about to be executed. We call this the <strong>control flow</strong>, of the <strong>flow of execution</strong> of the program. When humans execute programs, they often use their finger to point to each statement in turn. So we could think of control flow as “Python’s moving finger”.</p>
<p>Control flow until now has been strictly top to bottom, one statement at a time. The <code>for</code> loop changes this.</p>

<section class="level2" id="assignment">
<h2><a href="#assignment"><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Assignment</a></h2>
<p>As we have mentioned previously, it is legal to make more than one assignment to the same variable. A new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new value (and stop referring to the old value).</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python">airtime_remaining = <span class="dv">15</span>
<span class="kw">print</span>(airtime_remaining)
airtime_remaining = <span class="dv">7</span>
<span class="kw">print</span>(airtime_remaining)</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The output of this program is:</p>
<pre><code>15
7</code></pre>
<p>because the first time <code>airtime_remaining</code> is printed, its value is 15, and the second time, its value is 7.</p>
<p>It is especially important to distinguish between an assignment statement and a Boolean expression that tests for equality. Because Python uses the equal token (<code>=</code>) for assignment, it is tempting to interpret a statement like <code>a = b</code> as a Boolean test. Unlike mathematics, it is not! Remember that the Python token for the equality operator is <code>==</code>.</p>
<p>Note too that an equality test is symmetric, but assignment is not. For example, if <code>a == 7</code> then <code>7 == a</code>. But in Python, the statement <code>a = 7</code> is legal and <code>7 = a</code> is not.</p>
<p>In Python, an assignment statement can make two variables equal, but because further assignments can change either of them, they don’t have to stay that way:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python">a = <span class="dv">5</span>
b = a    <span class="co"># After executing this line, a and b are now equal</span>
a = <span class="dv">3</span>    <span class="co"># After executing this line, a and b are no longer equal</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The third line changes the value of <code>a</code> but does not change the value of <code>b</code>, so they are no longer equal. (In some programming languages, a different symbol is used for assignment, such as <code>&lt;-</code> or <code>:=</code>, to avoid confusion. Some people also think that <em>variable</em> was an unfortunae word to choose, and instead we should have called them <em>assignables</em>. Python chooses to follow common terminology and token usage, also found in languages like C, C++, Java, and C#, so we use the tokens <code>=</code> for assignment, <code>==</code> for equality, and we talk of <em>variables</em>.</p>

<section class="level2" id="updating-variables">
<h2><a href="#updating-variables"><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Updating variables</a></h2>
<p>When an assignment statement is executed, the right-hand side expression (i.e. the expression that comes after the assignment token) is evaluated first. This produces a value. Then the assignment is made, so that the variable on the left-hand side now refers to the new value.</p>
<p>One of the most common forms of assignment is an update, where the new value of the variable depends on its old value. Deduct 40 cents from my airtime balance, or add one run to the scoreboard.</p>

<p>Line 2 means <code>get the current value of n, multiply it by three and add one, and assign the answer to n, thus making n refer to the value</code>.<br />So after executing the two lines above, <code>n</code> will point/refer to the integer 16.</p>
<p>If you try to get the value of a variable that has never been assigned to, you’ll get an error:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; w = x + <span class="dv">1</span>

<span class="ot">NameError</span>: name <span class="st">&#39;x&#39;</span> is not defined</code></pre>
<p>Before you can update a variable, you have to <strong>initialize</strong> it to some starting value, usually with a simple assignment:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

<p>Line 3 — updating a variable by adding 1 to it — is very common.<br />It is called an <strong>increment</strong> of the variable; subtracting 1 is called a <strong>decrement</strong>.<br />Sometimes programmers also talk about <em>bumping</em> a variable, which means the same as incrementing it by 1.</p>

<section class="level2" id="the-for-loop-revisited">
<h2><a href="#the-for-loop-revisited"><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> The <code>for</code> loop revisited</a></h2>
<p>Recall that the <code>for</code> loop processes each item in a list. Each item in turn is (re-)assigned to the loop variable, and the body of the loop is executed. We saw this example earlier:</p>

<p>Running through all the items in a list is called <strong>traversing</strong> the list, or <strong>traversal</strong>.</p>
<p>Let us write a function now to sum up all the elements in a list of numbers. Do this by hand first, and try to isolate exactly what steps you take. You’ll find you need to keep some “running total” of the sum so far, either on a piece of paper, in your head, or in your calculator. Remembering things from one step to the next is precisely why we have variables in a program: so we’ll need some variable to remember the “running total”. It should be initialized with a value of zero, and then we need to traverse the items in the list. For each item, we’ll want to update the running total by adding the next number to it.</p>

<p>You can almost read the <code>while</code> statement as if it were English. It means, while <code>v</code> is less than or equal to <code>n</code>, continue executing the body of the loop. Within the body, each time, increment <code>v</code>. When <code>v</code> passes <code>n</code>, return your accumulated sum.</p>
<p>More formally, here is precise flow of execution for a <code>while</code> statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate the condition at line 5, yielding a value which is either <code>False</code> or <code>True</code>.</li>
<li>If the value is <code>False</code>, exit the <code>while</code> statement and continue execution at the next statement (line 8 in this case).</li>
<li>If the value is <code>True</code>, execute each of the statements in the body (lines 6 and 7) and then go back to the <code>while</code> statement at line 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>The body consists of all of the statements indented below the <code>while</code> keyword.</p>
<p>Notice that if the loop condition is <code>False</code> the first time we get loop, the statements in the body of the loop are never executed.</p>
<p>The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop terminates. Otherwise the loop will repeat forever, which is called an <strong>infinite loop</strong>. An endless source of amusement for computer scientists is the observation that the directions on shampoo, “lather, rinse, repeat”, are an infinite loop.</p>
<p>In the case here, we can prove that the loop terminates because we know that the value of <code>n</code> is finite, and we can see that the value of <code>v</code> increments each time through the loop, so eventually it will have to exceed <code>n</code>. In other cases, it is not so easy, even impossible in some cases, to tell if the loop will ever terminate.</p>
<p>What you will notice here is that the <code>while</code> loop is more work for you — the programmer — than the equivalent <code>for</code> loop. When using a <code>while</code> loop one has to manage the loop variable yourself: give it an initial value, test for completion, and then make sure you change something in the body so that the loop terminates. By comparison, here is an equivalent function that uses <code>for</code> instead:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> sum_to(n):
    <span class="co">&quot;&quot;&quot; Return the sum of 1+2+3 ... n &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    ss  = <span class="dv">0</span>
    <span class="kw">for</span> v in <span class="dt">range</span>(n<span class="dv">+1</span>):
        ss = ss + v
    <span class="kw">return</span> ss</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Notice the slightly tricky call to the <code>range</code> function — we had to add one onto <code>n</code>, because <code>range</code> generates its list up to but excluding the value you give it. It would be easy to make a programming mistake and overlook this, but because we’ve made the investment of writing some unit tests, our test suite would have caught our error.</p>
<p>So why have two kinds of loop if <code>for</code> looks easier? This next example shows a case where we need the extra power that we get from the <code>while</code> loop.</p>

<h2><a href="#the-collatz-3n-1-sequence"><span class="header-section-number">6.7</span> The Collatz 3n + 1 sequence</a></h2>
<p>Let’s look at a simple sequence that has fascinated and foxed mathematicians for many years. They still cannot answer even quite simple questions about this.</p>
<p>The “computational rule” for creating the sequence is to start from some given <code>n</code>, and to generate the next term of the sequence from <code>n</code>, either by halving <code>n</code>, (whenever <code>n</code> is even), or else by multiplying it by three and adding 1. The sequence terminates when <code>n</code> reaches 1.</p>
<p>This Python function captures that algorithm:</p>

    <span class="kw">print</span>(n, end=<span class="st">&quot;.</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>)</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Notice first that the print function on line 6 has an extra argument <code>end=&quot;, &quot;</code>. This tells the <code>print</code> function to follow the printed string with whatever the programmer chooses (in this case, a comma followed by a space), instead of ending the line. So each time something is printed in the loop, it is printed on the same output line, with the numbers separated by commas. The call to <code>print(n, end=&quot;.\n&quot;)</code> at line 11 after the loop terminates will then print the final value of <code>n</code> followed by a period and a newline character. (You’ll cover the <code>\n</code> (newline character) in the next chapter).</p>
<p>The condition for continuing with this loop is <code>n != 1</code>, so the loop will continue running until it reaches its termination condition, (i.e. <code>n == 1</code>).</p>
<p>Each time through the loop, the program outputs the value of <code>n</code> and then checks whether it is even or odd. If it is even, the value of <code>n</code> is divided by 2 using integer division. If it is odd, the value is replaced by <code>n * 3 + 1</code>.<br />Here are some examples:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; seq3np1(<span class="dv">3</span>)
<span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">16</span>, <span class="dv">8</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">1</span>.

&gt;&gt;&gt; </code></pre>
<p>Since <code>n</code> sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no obvious proof that <code>n</code> will ever reach 1, or that the program terminates. For some particular values of <code>n</code>, we can prove termination. For example, if the starting value is a power of two, then the value of <code>n</code> will be even each time through the loop until it reaches 1. The previous example ends with such a sequence, starting with 16.</p>
<p>See if you can find a small starting number that needs more than a hundred steps before it terminates.</p>
<p>Particular values aside, the interesting question was first posed by a German mathematician called Lothar Collatz: the <em>Collatz conjecture</em> (also known as the <em>3n + 1 conjecture</em>), is that this sequence terminates for <em>all</em> positive values of <code>n</code>. So far, no one has been able to prove it <em>or</em> disprove it!<br />(A conjecture is a statement that might be true, but nobody knows for sure.)</p>
<p>Think carefully about what would be needed for a proof or disproof of the conjecture <em>“All positive integers will eventually converge to 1 using the Collatz rules”</em>.<br />With fast computers we have been able to test every integer up to very large values, and so far, they have all eventually ended up at 1.<br />But who knows? Perhaps there is some as-yet untested number which does not reduce to 1.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that if you don’t stop when you reach 1, the sequence gets into its own cyclic loop: 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4 … So one possibility is that there might be other cycles that we just haven’t found yet.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has an informative article about the Collatz conjecture. The sequence also goes under other names (Hailstone sequence, Wonderous numbers, etc.), and you’ll find out just how many integers have already been tested by computer, and found to converge!</p>
<aside id="for-or-while">

<p><strong>Choosing between <code>for</code> and <code>while</code></strong></p>
<p>Use a <code>for</code> loop if you know, before you start looping, the maximum number of times that you’ll need to execute the body.<br />For example, if you’re traversing a list of elements, you know that the maximum number of loop iterations you can possibly need is “all the elements in the list”. Or if you need to print the 12 times table, we know right away how many times the loop will need to run.</p>
<p>So any problem like “iterate this weather model for 1000 cycles”, or “search this list of words”, “find all prime numbers up to 10000” suggest that a <code>for</code> loop is best.</p>
<p>By contrast, if you are required to repeat some computation until some condition is met, and you cannot calculate in advance when (of if) this will happen, as we did in this 3n + 1 problem, you’ll need a <code>while</code> loop.</p>
<p>We call the first case <strong>definite iteration</strong> — we know ahead of time some definite bounds for what is needed. The latter case is called <strong>indefinite iteration</strong> — we’re not sure how many iterations we’ll need — we cannot even establish an upper bound!</p>

<section class="level2" id="tracing-a-program">
<h2><a href="#tracing-a-program"><span class="header-section-number">6.8</span> Tracing a program</a></h2>
<p>To write effective computer programs, and to build a good conceptual model of program execution, a programmer needs to develop the ability to <strong>trace</strong> the execution of a computer program. Tracing involves becoming the computer and following the flow of execution through a sample program run, recording the state of all variables and any output the program generates after each instruction is executed.</p>
<p>To understand this process, let’s trace the call to <code>seq3np1(3)</code> from the previous section. At the start of the trace, we have a variable, <code>n</code> (the parameter), with an initial value of 3. Since 3 is not equal to 1, the <code>while</code> loop body is executed. 3 is printed and <code>3 % 2 == 0</code> is evaluated. Since it evaluates to <code>False</code>, the <code>else</code> branch is executed and <code>3 * 3 + 1</code> is evaluated and assigned to <code>n</code>.</p>
<p>To keep track of all this as you hand trace a program, make a column heading on a piece of paper for each variable created as the program runs and another one for output. Our trace so far would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>n               output printed so far
--              ---------------------
3               3, 
10</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>10 != 1</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>, the loop body is again executed, and 10 is printed. <code>10 % 2 == 0</code> is true, so the <code>if</code> branch is executed and <code>n</code> becomes 5. By the end of the trace we have:</p>
<pre><code>n               output printed so far
--              ---------------------
3               3,
10              3, 10,
5               3, 10, 5,
16              3, 10, 5, 16,
8               3, 10, 5, 16, 8,
4               3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4,
2               3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2,
1               3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.</code></pre>
<p>Tracing can be a bit tedious and error prone (that’s why we get computers to do this stuff in the first place!), but it is an essential skill for a programmer to have. From this trace we can learn a lot about the way our code works. We can observe that as soon as <code>n</code> becomes a power of 2, for example, the program will require log :sub:<code>2</code> (n) executions of the loop body to complete. We can also see that the final 1 will not be printed as output within the body of the loop, which is why we put the special <code>print</code> function at the end.</p>
<p>Tracing a program is, of course, related to single-stepping through your code and being able to inspect the variables. Using the computer to <strong>single-step</strong> for you is less error prone and more convenient. Also, as your programs get more complex, they might execute many millions of steps before they get to the code that you’re really interested in, so manual tracing becomes impossible. Being able to set a <strong>breakpoint</strong> where you need one is far more powerful. So we strongly encourage you to invest time in learning using to use your programming environment (PyScripter, in these notes) to full effect.</p>
<p>There are also some great visualization tools becoming available to help you trace and understand small fragments of Python code. The one we recommend is at http://netserv.ict.ru.ac.za/python3_viz</p>
<p>We’ve cautioned against chatterbox functions, but used them here.<br />As we learn a bit more Python, we’ll be able to show you how to generate a list of values to hold the sequence, rather than having the function print them. Doing this would remove the need to have all these pesky <code>print</code> functions in the middle of our logic, and will make the function more useful.</p>

<h2><a href="#counting-digits"><span class="header-section-number">6.9</span> Counting digits</a></h2>
<p>The following function counts the number of decimal digits in a positive integer:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> num_digits(n):
    count = <span class="dv">0</span>
    <span class="kw">while</span> n != <span class="dv">0</span>:
        count = count + <span class="dv">1</span>
        n = n // <span class="dv">10</span>
    <span class="kw">return</span> count</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>A call to <code>print(num_digits(710))</code> will print <code>3</code>. Trace the execution of this function call (perhaps using the single step function in PyScripter, or the Python visualizer, or on some paper) to convince yourself that it works.</p>
<p>This function demonstrates an important pattern of computation called a <strong>counter</strong>. The variable <code>count</code> is initialized to 0 and then incremented each time the loop body is executed. When the loop exits, <code>count</code> contains the result — the total number of times the loop body was executed, which is the same as the number of digits.</p>
<p>If we wanted to only count digits that are either 0 or 5, adding a conditional before incrementing the counter will do the trick:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

        digit = n % <span class="dv">10</span>
        <span class="kw">if</span> digit == <span class="dv">0</span> or digit == <span class="dv">5</span>:

        n = n // <span class="dv">10</span>
    <span class="kw">return</span> count</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Confirm that <code>test(num_zero_and_five_digits(1055030250) == 7)</code> passes.</p>
<p>Notice, however, that <code>test(num_digits(0) == 1)</code> fails. Explain why. Do you think this is a bug in the code, or a bug in the specifications, or our expectations, or the tests?</p>

<h2><a href="#abbreviated-assignment"><span class="header-section-number">6.10</span> Abbreviated assignment</a></h2>
<p>Incrementing a variable is so common that Python provides an abbreviated syntax for it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; count = <span class="dv">0</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; count += <span class="dv">1</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; count
<span class="dv">1</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; count += <span class="dv">1</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; count
<span class="dv">2</span></code></pre>
<p><code>count += 1</code> is an abreviation for <code>count = count + 1</code> . We pronounce the operator as <em>“plus-equals”</em>. The increment value does not have to be 1:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; n = <span class="dv">2</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; n += <span class="dv">5</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; n
<span class="dv">7</span></code></pre>
<p>There are similar abbreviations for <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code>, <code>//=</code> and <code>%=</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; n = <span class="dv">2</span>

<h2><a href="#help-and-meta-notation"><span class="header-section-number">6.11</span> Help and meta-notation</a></h2>
<p>Python comes with extensive documentation for all its built-in functions, and its libraries. Different systems have different ways of accessing this help. In PyScripter, click on the <em>Help</em> menu item, and select <em>Python Manuals</em>. Then search for help on the built-in function <strong>range</strong>. You’ll get something like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/help_range.png" />
</figure>
<p>Notice the square brackets in the description of the arguments. These are examples of <strong>meta-notation</strong> — notation that describes Python syntax, but is not part of it. The square brackets in this documentation mean that the argument is <em>optional</em> — the programmer can omit it. So what this first line of help tells us is that <code>range</code> must always have a <code>stop</code> argument, but it may have an optional <code>start</code> argument (which must be followed by a comma if it is present), and it can also have an optional <code>step</code> argument, preceded by a comma if it is present.</p>
<p>The examples from help show that <code>range</code> can have either 1, 2 or 3 arguments.<br />The list can start at any starting value, and go up or down in increments other than 1.<br />The documentation here also says that the arguments must be integers.</p>
<p>Other meta-notation you’ll frequently encounter is the use of bold and italics. The bold means that these are tokens — keywords or symbols — typed into your Python code exactly as they are, whereas the italic terms stand for “something of this type”. So the syntax description</p>
<pre><code>**for** *variable* **in** *list* **:** </code></pre>
<p>means you can substitute any legal variable and any legal list when you write your Python code.</p>
<p>This (simplified) description of the <code>print</code> function, shows another example of meta-notation in which the ellipses (<code>...</code>) mean that you can have as many objects as you like (even zero), separated by commas:</p>
<p><strong>print( [<em><em> </em>object,</em> … **] )</strong></p>
<p>Meta-notation gives us a concise and powerful way to describe the <em>pattern</em> of some syntax or feature.</p>

<section class="level2" id="tables">
<h2><a href="#tables"><span class="header-section-number">6.12</span> Tables</a></h2>
<p>One of the things loops are good for is generating tables. Before computers were readily available, people had to calculate logarithms, sines and cosines, and other mathematical functions by hand. To make that easier, mathematics books contained long tables listing the values of these functions. Creating the tables was slow and boring, and they tended to be full of errors.</p>
<p>When computers appeared on the scene, one of the initial reactions was, <em>“This is great! We can use the computers to generate the tables, so there will be no errors.”</em> That turned out to be true (mostly) but shortsighted. Soon thereafter, computers and calculators were so pervasive that the tables became obsolete.</p>
<p>Well, almost. For some operations, computers use tables of values to get an approximate answer and then perform computations to improve the approximation. In some cases, there have been errors in the underlying tables, most famously in the table the Intel Pentium processor chip used to perform floating-point division.</p>
<p>Although a log table is not as useful as it once was, it still makes a good example of iteration. The following program outputs a sequence of values in the left column and 2 raised to the power of that value in the right column:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">for</span> x in <span class="dt">range</span>(<span class="dv">13</span>):   <span class="co"># Generate numbers 0 to 12</span>
    <span class="kw">print</span>(x, <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ch">\t</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>**x)</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The string <code>&quot;\t&quot;</code> represents a <strong>tab character</strong>. The backslash character in <code>&quot;\t&quot;</code> indicates the beginning of an <strong>escape sequence</strong>. Escape sequences are used to represent invisible characters like tabs and newlines. The sequence <code>\n</code> represents a <strong>newline</strong>.</p>
<p>An escape sequence can appear anywhere in a string; in this example, the tab escape sequence is the only thing in the string. How do you think you represent a backslash in a string?</p>
<p>As characters and strings are displayed on the screen, an invisible marker called the <strong>cursor</strong> keeps track of where the next character will go. After a <code>print</code> function, the cursor normally goes to the beginning of the next line.</p>
<p>The tab character shifts the cursor to the right until it reaches one of the tab stops. Tabs are useful for making columns of text line up, as in the output of the previous program:</p>
<pre><code>0       1
1       2
2       4
3       8
4       16
5       32
6       64
7       128
8       256
9       512
10      1024
11      2048
12      4096</code></pre>
<p>Because of the tab characters between the columns, the position of the second column does not depend on the number of digits in the first column.</p>

<section class="level2" id="two-dimensional-tables">
<h2><a href="#two-dimensional-tables"><span class="header-section-number">6.13</span> Two-dimensional tables</a></h2>
<p>A two-dimensional table is a table where you read the value at the intersection of a row and a column. A multiplication table is a good example. Let’s say you want to print a multiplication table for the values from 1 to 6.</p>
<p>A good way to start is to write a loop that prints the multiples of 2, all on one line:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">for</span> i in <span class="dt">range</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">7</span>):
    <span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="dv">2</span> * i, end=<span class="st">&quot;   &quot;</span>)
<span class="kw">print</span>()</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Here we’ve used the <code>range</code> function, but made it start its sequence at 1. As the loop executes, the value of <code>i</code> changes from 1 to 6. When all the elements of the range have been assigned to <code>i</code>, the loop terminates. Each time through the loop, it displays the value of <code>2 * i</code>, followed by three spaces.</p>
<p>Again, the extra <code>end=&quot;   &quot;</code> argument in the <code>print</code> function suppresses the newline, and uses three spaces instead. After the loop completes, the call to <code>print</code> at line 3 finishes the current line, and starts a new line.</p>
<p>The output of the program is:</p>
<pre><code>2      4      6      8      10     12Z</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good. The next step is to <strong>encapsulate</strong> and <strong>generalize</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="encapsulation-and-generalization">
<h2><a href="#encapsulation-and-generalization"><span class="header-section-number">6.14</span> Encapsulation and generalization</a></h2>
<p>Encapsulation is the process of wrapping a piece of code in a function, allowing you to take advantage of all the things functions are good for. You have already seen some examples of encapsulation, including <code>is_divisible</code> in a previous chapter.</p>
<p>Generalization means taking something specific, such as printing the multiples of 2, and making it more general, such as printing the multiples of any integer.</p>
<p>This function encapsulates the previous loop and generalizes it to print multiples of <code>n</code>:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> print_multiples(n):
    <span class="kw">for</span> i in <span class="dt">range</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">7</span>):
        <span class="kw">print</span>(n * i, end=<span class="st">&quot;   &quot;</span>)
    <span class="kw">print</span>()</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>To encapsulate, all we had to do was add the first line, which declares the name of the function and the parameter list. To generalize, all we had to do was replace the value 2 with the parameter <code>n</code>.</p>
<p>If we call this function with the argument 2, we get the same output as before. With the argument 3, the output is:</p>
<pre><code>3      6      9      12     15     18</code></pre>
<p>With the argument 4, the output is:</p>
<pre><code>4      8      12     16     20     24</code></pre>
<p>By now you can probably guess how to print a multiplication table — by calling <code>print_multiples</code> repeatedly with different arguments. In fact, we can use another loop:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">for</span> i in <span class="dt">range</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">7</span>):
    print_multiples(i)</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Notice how similar this loop is to the one inside <code>print_multiples</code>. All we did was replace the <code>print</code> function with a function call.</p>
<p>The output of this program is a multiplication table:</p>
<pre><code>1      2      3      4      5      6
2      4      6      8      10     12
3      6      9      12     15     18
4      8      12     16     20     24
5      10     15     20     25     30
6      12     18     24     30     36</code></pre>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="more-encapsulation">
<h2><a href="#more-encapsulation"><span class="header-section-number">6.15</span> More encapsulation</a></h2>
<p>To demonstrate encapsulation again, let’s take the code from the last section and wrap it up in a function:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> print_mult_table():

        print_multiples(i)</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>This process is a common <strong>development plan</strong>. We develop code by writing lines of code outside any function, or typing them in to the interpreter. When we get the code working, we extract it and wrap it up in a function.</p>
<p>This development plan is particularly useful if you don’t know how to divide the program into functions when you start writing. This approach lets you design as you go along.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="local-variables">
<h2><a href="#local-variables"><span class="header-section-number">6.16</span> Local variables</a></h2>
<p>You might be wondering how we can use the same variable, <code>i</code>, in both <code>print_multiples</code> and <code>print_mult_table</code>. Doesn’t it cause problems when one of the functions changes the value of the variable?</p>
<p>The answer is no, because the <code>i</code> in <code>print_multiples</code> and the <code>i</code> in <code>print_mult_table</code> are <em>not</em> the same variable.</p>
<p>Variables created inside a function definition are local; you can’t access a local variable from outside its home function. That means you are free to have multiple variables with the same name as long as they are not in the same function.</p>
<p>Python examines all the statements in a function — if any of them assign a value to a variable, that is the clue that Python uses to make the variable a local variable.</p>
<p>The stack diagram for this program shows that the two variables named <code>i</code> are not the same variable. They can refer to different values, and changing one does not affect the other.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/stack2.png" title="Stack 2 diagram" />
</figure>
<p>The value of <code>i</code> in <code>print_mult_table</code> goes from 1 to 6. In the diagram it happens to be 3. The next time through the loop it will be 4. Each time through the loop, <code>print_mult_table</code> calls <code>print_multiples</code> with the current value of <code>i</code> as an argument. That value gets assigned to the parameter <code>n</code>.</p>
<p>Inside <code>print_multiples</code>, the value of <code>i</code> goes from 1 to 6. In the diagram, it happens to be 2. Changing this variable has no effect on the value of <code>i</code> in <code>print_mult_table</code>.</p>
<p>It is common and perfectly legal to have different local variables with the same name. In particular, names like <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are used frequently as loop variables. If you avoid using them in one function just because you used them somewhere else, you will probably make the program harder to read.</p>
<p>The visualizer at http://netserv.ict.ru.ac.za/python3_viz/ shows very clearly how the two variables <code>i</code> are distinct variables, and how they have independent values.</p>

<section class="level2" id="more-generalization">
<h2><a href="#more-generalization"><span class="header-section-number">6.19</span> More generalization</a></h2>
<p>As another example of generalization, imagine you wanted a program that would print a multiplication table of any size, not just the six-by-six table. You could add a parameter to <code>print_mult_table</code>:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> print_mult_table(high):

        print_multiples(i)</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>We replaced the value 7 with the expression <code>high+1</code>. If we call <code>print_mult_table</code> with the argument 7, it displays:</p>
<pre><code>1      2      3      4      5      6
2      4      6      8      10     12
3      6      9      12     15     18
4      8      12     16     20     24

7      14     21     28     35     42</code></pre>
<p>This is fine, except that we probably want the table to be square — with the same number of rows and columns. To do that, we add another parameter to <code>print_multiples</code> to specify how many columns the table should have.</p>
<p>Just to be annoying, we call this parameter <code>high</code>, demonstrating that different functions can have parameters with the same name (just like local variables). Here’s the whole program:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

        print_multiples(i, high)</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Notice that when we added a new parameter, we had to change the first line of the function (the function heading), and we also had to change the place where the function is called in <code>print_mult_table</code>.</p>
<p>Now, when we call <code>print_mult_table(7)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>1      2      3      4      5      6      7

7      14     21     28     35     42     49</code></pre>
<p>When you generalize a function appropriately, you often get a program with capabilities you didn’t plan. For example, you might notice that, because ab = ba, all the entries in the table appear twice. You could save ink by printing only half the table. To do that, you only have to change one line of <code>print_mult_table</code>. Change</p>

<p>A few times now, we have mentioned all the things functions are good for. By now, you might be wondering what exactly those things are. Here are some of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capturing your mental chunking. Breaking your complex tasks into sub-tasks, and giving the sub-tasks a meaningful name is a powerful mental technique. Look back at the example that illustrated the post-test loop: we assumed that we had a function called <code>play_the_game_once</code>. This chunking allowed us to put aside the details of the particular game — is it a card game, or noughts and crosses, or a role playing game — and simply focus on one isolated part of our program logic — letting the player choose whether they want to play again.<br /></li>
<li>Dividing a long program into functions allows you to separate parts of the program, debug them in isolation, and then compose them into a whole.</li>
<li>Functions facilitate the use of iteration.</li>
<li>Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.</li>
</ol>

<section class="level2" id="paired-data">
<h2><a href="#paired-data"><span class="header-section-number">6.21</span> Paired Data</a></h2>
<p>We’ve already seen lists of names and lists of numbers in Python. We’re going to peek ahead in the textbook a little, and show a more advanced way of representing our data. Making a pair of things in Python is as simple as putting them into parentheses, like this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">year_born = (<span class="st">&quot;Paris Hilton&quot;</span>, <span class="dv">1981</span>) </code></pre>
<p>We can put many pairs into a list of pairs:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">celebs = [(<span class="st">&quot;Brad Pitt&quot;</span>, <span class="dv">1963</span>), (<span class="st">&quot;Jack Nicholson&quot;</span>, <span class="dv">1937</span>), 
                                (<span class="st">&quot;Justin Bieber&quot;</span>, <span class="dv">1994</span>)] </code></pre>
<p>Here is a quick sample of things we can do with structured data like this. First, print all the celebs:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">print</span>(celebs)
<span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="dt">len</span>(celebs))    </code></pre>
<pre><code>    [(&quot;Brad Pitt&quot;, 1963), (&quot;Jack Nicholson&quot;, 1937), (&quot;Justin Bieber&quot;, 1994)]
    3</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the <code>celebs</code> list has just 3 elements, each of them pairs.</p>
<p>Now we print the names of those celebrities born before 1980:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">for</span> (nm, yr) in celebs:
   <span class="kw">if</span> yr &lt; <span class="dv">1980</span>:
        <span class="kw">print</span>(nm)</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<pre><code>Brad Pitt
Jack Nicholson</code></pre>
<p>This demonstrates something we have not seen yet in the <code>for</code> loop: instead of using a single loop control variable, we’ve used a pair of variable names, <code>(nm, yr)</code>, instead. The loop is executed three times — once for each pair in the list, and on each iteration both the variables are assigned values from the pair of data that is being handled.</p>

<p>Now we’ll come up with an even more adventurous list of structured data. In this case, we have a list of students. Each student has a name which is paired up with another list of subjects that they are enrolled for:</p>

<p>Here we’ve assigned a list of five elements to the variable <code>students</code>. Let’s print out each student name, and the number of subjects they are enrolled for:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

<pre><code>    John takes 2 courses
    Vusi takes 3 courses
    Jess takes 4 courses
    Sarah takes 4 courses
    Zuki takes 5 courses</code></pre>
<p>Now we’d like to ask how many students are taking CompSci. This needs a counter, and for each student we need a second loop that tests each of the subjects in turn:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

<pre><code>    The number of students taking CompSci is 3</code></pre>
<p>You should set up a list of your own data that interests you — perhaps a list of your CDs, each containing a list of song titles on the CD, or a list of movie titles, each with a list of movie stars who acted in the movie. You could then ask questions like “Which movies starred Angelina Jolie?”</p>
<p>.. index:: single: Newton’s method</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="newtons-method-for-finding-square-roots">
<h2><a href="#newtons-method-for-finding-square-roots"><span class="header-section-number">6.23</span> Newton’s method for finding square roots</a></h2>
<p>Loops are often used in programs that compute numerical results by starting with an approximate answer and iteratively improving it.</p>
<p>For example, before we had calculators or computers, people needed to calculate square roots manually. Newton used a particularly good method (there is some evidence that this method was known many years before).<br />Suppose that you want to know the square root of <code>n</code>. If you start with almost any approximation, you can compute a better approximation (closer to the actual answer) with the following formula:</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.python .numberLines}<br /> better = (approx + n/approx)/2</p>
<p>Repeat this calculation a few times using your calculator. Can you see why each iteration brings your estimate a little closer? One of the amazing properties of this particular algorithm is how quickly it converges to an accurate answer — a great advantage for doing it manually.</p>
<p>By using a loop and repeating this formula until the better approximation gets close enough to the previous one, we can write a function for computing the square root. (In fact, this is how your calculator finds square roots — it may have a slightly different formula and method, but it is also based on repeatedly improving its guesses.)</p>
<p>This is an example of an <code>indefinite</code> iteration problem: we cannot predict in advance how many times we’ll want to improve our guess — we just want to keep getting closer and closer. Our stopping condition for the loop will be when our old guess and our improved guess are “close enough” to each other.</p>
<p>Ideally, we’d like the old and new guess to be exactly equal to each other when we stop.<br />But exact equality is a tricky notion in computer arithmetic when real numbers are involved.<br />Because real numbers are not represented absolutely accurately (after all, a number like pi or the square root of two has an infinite number of decimal places because it is irrational), we need to formulate the stopping test for the loop by asking “is <code>a</code> close enough to <code>b</code>”? This stopping condition can be coded like this:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">if</span> <span class="dt">abs</span>(a-b) &lt; <span class="fl">0.001</span>:  <span class="co"># Make this smaller for better accuracy</span>
      <span class="kw">break</span>   </code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Notice that we take the absolute value of the difference between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>!</p>
<p>This problem is also a good example of when a middle-exit loop is appropriate:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

    <span class="kw">while</span> <span class="ot">True</span>:
        better = (approx + n/approx)/<span class="fl">2.0</span>
        <span class="kw">if</span> <span class="dt">abs</span>(approx - better) &lt; <span class="fl">0.001</span>:

<span class="kw">print</span>(sqrt(<span class="fl">49.0</span>))
<span class="kw">print</span>(sqrt(<span class="fl">81.0</span>))</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The output is:</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<pre><code>    5.00000000002
    7.0
    9.0</code></pre>
<p>See if you can improve the approximations by changing the stopping condition. Also, step through the algorithm (perhaps by hand, using your calculator) to see how many iterations were needed before it achieved this level of accuracy for <code>sqrt(25)</code>.</p>

<h2><a href="#algorithms"><span class="header-section-number">6.24</span> Algorithms</a></h2>
<p>Newton’s method is an example of an <strong>algorithm</strong>: it is a mechanical process for solving a category of problems (in this case, computing square roots).</p>
<p>Some kinds of knowledge are not algorithmic. For example, learning dates from history or your multiplication tables involves memorization of specific solutions.</p>
<p>But the techniques you learned for addition with carrying, subtraction with borrowing, and long division are all algorithms. Or if you are an avid Sudoku puzzle solver, you might have some specific set of steps that you always follow.</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of algorithms is that they do not require any intelligence to carry out. They are mechanical processes in which each step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules. And they’re designed to solve a general class or category of problems, not just a single problem.</p>
<p>Understanding that hard problems can be solved by step-by-step algorithmic processes (and having technology to execute these algorithms for us) is one of the major breakthroughs that has had enormous benefits. So while the execution of the algorithm may be boring and may require no intelligence, algorithmic or computational thinking — i.e. using algorithms and automation as the basis for approaching problems — is rapidly transforming our society. Some claim that this shift towards algorithmic thinking and processes is going to have even more impact on our society than the invention of the printing press.<br />And the process of designing algorithms is interesting, intellectually challenging, and a central part of what we call programming.</p>
<p>Some of the things that people do naturally, without difficulty or conscious thought, are the hardest to express algorithmically. Understanding natural language is a good example. We all do it, but so far no one has been able to explain <em>how</em> we do it, at least not in the form of a step-by-step mechanical algorithm.</p>

<p>This chapter showed us how to sum a list of items, and how to count items. The counting example also had an <code>if</code> statement that let us only count some selected items. In the previous chapter we also showed a function <code>find_first_2_letter_word</code> that allowed us an “early exit” from inside a loop by using <code>return</code> when some condition occurred. We now also have <code>break</code> to exit a loop (but not the enclosing function, and <code>continue</code> to abandon the current iteration of the loop without ending the loop.</p>
<p>Composition of list traversal, summing, counting, testing conditions and early exit is a rich collection of building blocks that can be combined in powerful ways to create many functions that are all slightly different.</p>

<h1><a href="#lists"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Lists</a></h1>
<p>A <strong>list</strong> is an ordered collection of values. The values that make up a list are called its <strong>elements</strong>, or its <strong>items</strong>. We will use the term <code>element</code> or <code>item</code> to mean the same thing. Lists are similar to strings, which are ordered collections of characters, except that the elements of a list can be of any type. Lists and strings — and other collections that maintain the order of their items — are called <strong>sequences</strong>.</p>
<section class="level2" id="list-values">
<h2><a href="#list-values"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> List values</a></h2>
<p>There are several ways to create a new list; the simplest is to enclose the elements in square brackets (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">ps = [<span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dv">20</span>, <span class="dv">30</span>, <span class="dv">40</span>]
qs = [<span class="st">&quot;spam&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;bungee&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;swallow&quot;</span>]</code></pre>
<p>The first example is a list of four integers. The second is a list of three strings. The elements of a list don’t have to be the same type. The following list contains a string, a float, an integer, and (amazingly) another list:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">zs = [<span class="st">&quot;hello&quot;</span>, <span class="fl">2.0</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, [<span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dv">20</span>]]</code></pre>
<p>A list within another list is said to be <strong>nested</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, a list with no elements is called an empty list, and is denoted <code>[]</code>.</p>
<p>We have already seen that we can assign list values to variables or pass lists as parameters to functions:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; vocabulary = [<span class="st">&quot;apple&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;cheese&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;dog&quot;</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [<span class="dv">17</span>, <span class="dv">123</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt; an_empty_list = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="kw">print</span>(vocabulary, numbers, an_empty_list)
[<span class="st">&quot;apple&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;cheese&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;dog&quot;</span>] [<span class="dv">17</span>, <span class="dv">123</span>] []</code></pre>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="accessing-elements">
<h2><a href="#accessing-elements"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Accessing elements</a></h2>
<p>The syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as the syntax for accessing the characters of a string — the index operator: <code>[]</code> (not to be confused with an empty list). The expression inside the brackets specifies the index. Remember that the indices start at 0:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[<span class="dv">0</span>]
<span class="dv">17</span></code></pre>
<p>Any expression evaluating to an integer can be used as an index:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[<span class="dv">9-8</span>]
<span class="dv">5</span>

<p>The function <code>len</code> returns the length of a list, which is equal to the number of its elements. If you are going to use an integer index to access the list, it is a good idea to use this value as the upper bound of a loop instead of a constant. That way, if the size of the list changes, you won’t have to go through the program changing all the loops; they will work correctly for any size list:</p>

<h2><a href="#lists-are-mutable"><span class="header-section-number">7.7</span> Lists are mutable</a></h2>
<p>Unlike strings, lists are <strong>mutable</strong>, which means we can change their elements. Using the index operator on the left side of an assignment, we can update one of the elements:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit = [<span class="st">&quot;banana&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;apple&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;quince&quot;</span>]

&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit
[<span class="st">&#39;pear&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;apple&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;orange&#39;</span>]</code></pre>
<p>The bracket operator applied to a list can appear anywhere in an expression. When it appears on the left side of an assignment, it changes one of the elements in the list, so the first element of <code>fruit</code> has been changed from <code>&quot;banana&quot;</code> to <code>&quot;pear&quot;</code>, and the last from <code>&quot;quince&quot;</code> to <code>&quot;orange&quot;</code>. An assignment to an element of a list is called <strong>item assignment</strong>. Item assignment does not work for strings:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_string = <span class="st">&quot;TEST&quot;</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_string[<span class="dv">2</span>] = <span class="st">&quot;X&quot;</span>

<p>With the slice operator we can update a whole sublist at once:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; a_list = [<span class="st">&quot;a&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;b&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;c&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;d&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;e&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;f&quot;</span>]

<p>We can also remove elements from a list by assigning an empty list to them:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; a_list = [<span class="st">&quot;a&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;b&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;c&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;d&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;e&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;f&quot;</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_list[<span class="dv">1</span>:<span class="dv">3</span>] = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_list

<p>And we can add elements to a list by squeezing them into an empty slice at the desired location:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; a_list = [<span class="st">&quot;a&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;d&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;f&quot;</span>]

<h2><a href="#list-deletion"><span class="header-section-number">7.8</span> List deletion</a></h2>
<p>Using slices to delete list elements can be error-prone. Python provides an alternative that is more readable. The <code>del</code> statement removes an element from a list:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [<span class="st">&quot;one&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;two&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;three&quot;</span>]

<p>As you might expect, <code>del</code> causes a runtime error if the index is out of range.</p>
<p>You can also use <code>del</code> with a slice to delete a sublist:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; a_list = [<span class="st">&quot;a&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;b&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;c&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;d&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;e&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;f&quot;</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="kw">del</span> a_list[<span class="dv">1</span>:<span class="dv">5</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_list
[<span class="st">&#39;a&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;f&#39;</span>]</code></pre>
<p>As usual, the sublist selected by slice contains all the elements up to, but not including, the second index.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="objects-and-references">
<h2><a href="#objects-and-references"><span class="header-section-number">7.9</span> Objects and references</a></h2>
<p>After we execute these assignment statements</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">a = <span class="st">&quot;banana&quot;</span>
b = <span class="st">&quot;banana&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>we know that <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> will refer to a string object with the letters <code>&quot;banana&quot;</code>. But we don’t know yet whether they point to the <em>same</em> string object.</p>
<p>There are two possible ways the Python interpreter could arrange its memory:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/list1.png" />
</figure>
<p>In one case, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> refer to two different objects that have the same value. In the second case, they refer to the same object.</p>
<p>We can test whether two names refer to the same object using the <code>is</code> operator:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
<span class="ot">True</span></code></pre>
<p>This tells us that both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> refer to the same object, and that it is the second of the two state snapshots that accurately describes the relationship.</p>
<p>Since strings are <em>immutable</em>, Python optimizes resources by making two names that refer to the same string value refer to the same object.</p>
<p>This is not the case with lists:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
<span class="ot">True</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
<span class="ot">False</span>   </code></pre>
<p>The state snapshot here looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/mult_references2.png" title="State snapshot for equal different lists" />
</figure>
<p><code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have the same value but do not refer to the same object.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="aliasing">
<h2><a href="#aliasing"><span class="header-section-number">7.10</span> Aliasing</a></h2>
<p>Since variables refer to objects, if we assign one variable to another, both variables refer to the same object:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
<span class="ot">True</span></code></pre>
<p>In this case, the state snapshot looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/mult_references3.png" title="State snapshot for multiple references (aliases) to a list" />
</figure>
<p>Because the same list has two different names, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, we say that it is <strong>aliased</strong>. Changes made with one alias affect the other:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; b[<span class="dv">0</span>] = <span class="dv">5</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[<span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>]</code></pre>
<p>Although this behavior can be useful, it is sometimes unexpected or undesirable. In general, it is safer to avoid aliasing when you are working with mutable objects (i.e. lists at this point in our textbook, but we’ll meet more mutable objects as we cover classes and objects, dictionaries and sets). Of course, for immutable objects (i.e. strings, tuples), there’s no problem — it is just not possible to change something and get a surprise when you access an alias name. That’s why Python is free to alias strings (and any other immutable kinds of data) when it sees an opportunity to economize.</p>

<section class="level2" id="cloning-lists">
<h2><a href="#cloning-lists"><span class="header-section-number">7.11</span> Cloning lists</a></h2>
<p>If we want to modify a list and also keep a copy of the original, we need to be able to make a copy of the list itself, not just the reference. This process is sometimes called <strong>cloning</strong>, to avoid the ambiguity of the word copy.</p>
<p>The easiest way to clone a list is to use the slice operator:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a[:]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
[<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>]</code></pre>
<p>Taking any slice of <code>a</code> creates a new list. In this case the slice happens to consist of the whole list. So now the relationship is like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/mult_references2.png" title="State snapshot for equal different lists" />
</figure>
<p>Now we are free to make changes to <code>b</code> without worrying that we’ll inadvertently be changing <code>a</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; b[<span class="dv">0</span>] = <span class="dv">5</span>

<p>The first example prints all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 19. The second example expresses enthusiasm for various fruits.</p>
<p>Since lists are mutable, we often want to traverse a list, changing each of its elements. The following squares all the numbers in the list <code>xs</code>:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python">xs = [<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>]

<span class="kw">for</span> i in <span class="dt">range</span>(<span class="dt">len</span>(xs)):
    xs[i] = xs[i]**<span class="dv">2</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Take a moment to think about <code>range(len(xs))</code> until you understand how it works.</p>
<p>In this example we are interested in both the <em>value</em> of an item, (we want to square that value), and its <em>index</em> (so that we can assign the new value to that position). This pattern is common enough that Python provides a nicer way to implement it:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python">xs = [<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>]

<span class="kw">for</span> (i, val) in <span class="dt">enumerate</span>(xs):
    xs[i] = val**<span class="dv">2</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p><code>enumerate</code> generates pairs of both (index, value) during the list traversal. Try this next example to see more clearly how <code>enumerate</code> works:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

     <span class="kw">print</span>(i, v)

<p>Passing a list as an argument actually passes a <em>reference</em> to the list, not a copy or clone of the list. So parameter passing creates an alias for you: the caller has one variable referencing the list, and the called function has an alias, but there is only one underlying list object.</p>
<p>For example, the function below takes a list as an argument and multiplies each element in the list by 2:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4

    <span class="kw">for</span> (idx, val) in <span class="dt">enumerate</span>(a_list):
        a_list[idx] = <span class="dv">2</span> * val</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>If we add the following onto our script:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python">things = [<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">9</span>]
double_stuff(things)
<span class="kw">print</span>(things)</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>When we run it we’ll get:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">[<span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dv">18</span>]</code></pre>
<p>In the function above, the parameter <code>a_list</code> and the variable <code>things</code> are aliases for the same object. So before any changes to the elements in the list, the state snapshot looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/mult_references4.png" title="State snapshot for multiple references to a list as a parameter" />
</figure>
<p>Since the list object is shared by two frames, we drew it between them.</p>
<p>If a function modifies the items of a list parameter, the caller sees the change.</p>

<h2><a href="#pure-functions-and-modifiers"><span class="header-section-number">7.15</span> Pure functions and modifiers</a></h2>
<p>Functions which take lists as arguments and change them during execution are called <strong>modifiers</strong> and the changes they make are called <strong>side effects</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>pure function</strong> does not produce side effects. It communicates with the calling program only through parameters, which it does not modify, and a return value. Here is <code>double_stuff</code> written as a pure function:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2

<p>This version of <code>double_stuff</code> does not change its arguments:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; things = [<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">9</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt; xs = double_stuff(things)

&gt;&gt;&gt; xs
[<span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dv">18</span>]</code></pre>
<p>An early rule we saw for assignment said “first evaluate the right hand side, then assign the resulting value to the variable”. So it is quite safe to assign the function result to the same variable that was passed to the function:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; things = [<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">9</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt; things = double_stuff(things)

<aside id="pure-functions">

<p><strong>Which style is better?</strong></p>
<p>Anything that can be done with modifiers can also be done with pure functions. In fact, some programming languages only allow pure functions. There is some evidence that programs that use pure functions are faster to develop and less error-prone than programs that use modifiers. Nevertheless, modifiers are convenient at times, and in some cases, functional programs are less efficient.</p>
<p>In general, we recommend that you write pure functions whenever it is reasonable to do so and resort to modifiers only if there is a compelling advantage. This approach might be called a <em>functional programming style</em>.</p>

<h2><a href="#functions-that-produce-lists"><span class="header-section-number">7.16</span> Functions that produce lists</a></h2>
<p>The pure version of <code>double_stuff</code> above made use of an important <strong>pattern</strong> for your toolbox. Whenever you need to write a function that creates and returns a list, the pattern is usually:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">initialize a result variable to be an empty <span class="dt">list</span>
loop
   create a new element 
   append it to result
<span class="kw">return</span> the result</code></pre>
<p>Let us show another use of this pattern. Assume you already have a function <code>is_prime(x)</code> that can test if x is prime. Write a function to return a list of all prime numbers less than n:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

<section class="level2" id="strings-and-lists">
<h2><a href="#strings-and-lists"><span class="header-section-number">7.17</span> Strings and lists</a></h2>
<p>Two of the most useful methods on strings involve conversion to and from lists of substrings.<br />The <code>split</code> method (which we’ve already seen) breaks a string into a list of words. By default, any number of whitespace characters is considered a word boundary:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; song = <span class="st">&quot;The rain in Spain...&quot;</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; wds = song.split()
&gt;&gt;&gt; wds
[<span class="st">&#39;The&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;rain&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;in&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;Spain...&#39;</span>]</code></pre>
<p>An optional argument called a <strong>delimiter</strong> can be used to specify which string to use as the boundary marker between substrings. The following example uses the string <code>ai</code> as the delimiter:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; song.split(<span class="st">&quot;ai&quot;</span>)
[<span class="st">&#39;The r&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;n in Sp&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;n...&#39;</span>]</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the delimiter doesn’t appear in the result.</p>
<p>The inverse of the <code>split</code> method is <code>join</code>. You choose a desired <strong>separator</strong> string, (often called the <em>glue</em>) and join the list with the glue between each of the elements:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; glue = <span class="st">&quot;;&quot;</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = glue.join(wds)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
<span class="st">&#39;The;rain;in;Spain...&#39;</span></code></pre>
<p>The list that you glue together (<code>wds</code> in this example) is not modified. Also, as these next examples show, you can use empty glue or multi-character strings as glue:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="st">&quot; --- &quot;</span>.join(wds)
<span class="st">&#39;The --- rain --- in --- Spain...&#39;</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>.join(wds)
<span class="st">&#39;TheraininSpain...&#39;</span></code></pre>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="list-and-range">
<h2><a href="#list-and-range"><span class="header-section-number">7.18</span> <code>list</code> and <code>range</code></a></h2>
<p>Python has a built-in type conversion function called <code>list</code> that tries to turn whatever you give it into a list.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; xs = <span class="dt">list</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Crunchy Frog&quot;</span>)
&gt;&gt;&gt; xs
[<span class="st">&quot;C&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;r&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;u&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;n&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;c&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;h&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;y&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot; &quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;F&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;r&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;o&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;g&quot;</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>.join(xs)
<span class="st">&#39;Crunchy Frog&#39;</span></code></pre>
<p>One particular feature of <code>range</code> is that it doesn’t instantly compute all its values: it “puts off” the computation, and does it on demand, or “lazily”. We’ll say that it gives a <strong>promise</strong> to produce the values when they are needed. This is very convenient if your computation short-circuits a search and returns early, as in this case:</p>
<table class="sourceCode python numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> f(n):
    <span class="co">&quot;&quot;&quot; Find the first positive integer between 101 and less </span>
<span class="co">        than n that is divisible by 21 </span>
<span class="co">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="kw">for</span> i in <span class="dt">range</span>(<span class="dv">101</span>, n):
       <span class="kw">if</span> (i % <span class="dv">21</span> == <span class="dv">0</span>):
           <span class="kw">return</span> i
            
            
test(f(<span class="dv">110</span>) == <span class="dv">105</span>)
test(f(<span class="dv">1000000000</span>) == <span class="dv">105</span>)</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>In the second test, if range were to eagerly go about building a list with all those elements, you would soon exhaust your computer’s available memory and crash the program. But it is cleverer than that! This computation works just fine, because the <code>range</code> object is just a promise to produce the elements if and when they are needed. Once the condition in the <code>if</code> becomes true, no further elements are generated, and the function returns. (Note: Before Python 3, <code>range</code> was not lazy. If you use an earlier versions of Python, YMMV!)</p>
<aside id="ymmv">

<p><strong>YMMV: Your Mileage May Vary</strong></p>
<p>The acronym YMMV stands for <em>your mileage may vary</em>. American car advertisements often quoted fuel consumption figures for cars, e.g. that they would get 28 miles per gallon. But this always had to be accompanied by legal small-print warning the reader that they might not get the same. The term YMMV is now used idiomatically to mean “your results may differ”, e.g. <em>The battery life on this phone is 3 days, but YMMV.</em></p>
</aside>
    
<p>You’ll sometimes find the lazy <code>range</code> wrapped in a call to <code>list</code>. This forces Python to turn the lazy promise into an actual list:</p>

<section class="level2" id="nested-lists">
<h2><a href="#nested-lists"><span class="header-section-number">7.19</span> Nested lists</a></h2>
<p>A nested list is a list that appears as an element in another list. In this list, the element with index 3 is a nested list:</p>

<section class="level2" id="matrices">
<h2><a href="#matrices"><span class="header-section-number">7.20</span> Matrices</a></h2>
<p>Nested lists are often used to represent matrices. For example, the matrix:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/matrix2.png" />
</figure>
<p>might be represented as:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; mx = [[<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>], [<span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">6</span>], [<span class="dv">7</span>, <span class="dv">8</span>, <span class="dv">9</span>]]</code></pre>
<p><code>mx</code> is a list with three elements, where each element is a row of the matrix. We can select an entire row from the matrix in the usual way:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; mx[<span class="dv">1</span>]
[<span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">6</span>]</code></pre>
<p>Or we can extract a single element from the matrix using the double-index form:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; mx[<span class="dv">1</span>][<span class="dv">2</span>]
<span class="dv">6</span></code></pre>
<p>The first index selects the row, and the second index selects the column. Although this way of representing matrices is common, it is not the only possibility. A small variation is to use a list of columns instead of a list of rows. Later we will see a more radical alternative using a dictionary.</p>

<dt>object</dt>
<dd><p>A thing to which a variable can refer.</p>
</dd>
<dt>pattern</dt>
<dd><p>A sequence of statements, or a style of coding something that has general applicability in a number of different situations. Part of becoming a mature Computer Scientist is to learn and establish the patterns and algorithms that form your toolkit. Patterns often correspond to your “mental chunking”.</p>
</dd>
<dt>promise</dt>
<dd><p>An object that promises to do some work or deliver some values if they’re eventually needed, but it lazily puts off doing the work immediately. Calling <code>range</code> produces a promise.</p>
</dd>
<dt>pure function</dt>
<dd><p>A function which has no side effects. Pure functions only make changes to the calling program through their return values.</p>

<h3><a href="#basic-questions"><span class="header-section-number">7.22.1</span> Basic Questions</a></h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Write a loop that prints out the even numbers from 1-100 (including 100)</li>
<li>Re-write your function from question 1 to solve the problem using a <code>range()</code> where you pass 3 arguments to <code>range</code>: <strong>start</strong>, <strong>stop</strong>, and <strong>step</strong>. <em>Hint:</em> see the <a href="#list-and-range">list and range</a> section above to see how to convert a range to a list.</li>
<li>Write a function that returns a list with all of multiples of 5 between 5 and 100 (i.e. count by fives). [5,10,15,20 …, 100]</li>
<li>Write a function that finds and returns the average of a list of numbers.</li>
<li>Write a function called <code>filter_word</code> which takes a list of strings and a <code>word</code> to filter as arguments and returns a new list with all instances of <code>word</code> removed. This function should not modify the original list.</li>
<li>Re-write question 5 as a modifier function without a return statement. It should usethe list method <code>remove()</code> to remove all intances of <code>word</code> from the list.</li>

<h3><a href="#advanced-questions"><span class="header-section-number">7.22.2</span> Advanced Questions</a></h3>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Write a function called <code>remove_duplicates</code> that takes a list and returns a new list with only the unique elements from the original. <em>Hint:</em> they don’t have to be in the same order.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a function called <code>combine</code> that takes 2 lists of strings as parameters and returns a new list of strings which concatenates the items from the first list with the item from the second. If the lists are not equal in length, the new list will end with the item from the longer list. For example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">a = [<span class="st">&quot;cat&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;dog&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;bird&quot;</span>]
b = [<span class="st">&quot;lion&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;wolf&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;eagle&quot;</span>]
c = combine(a,b)
<span class="kw">print</span>(c)
&gt;&gt;&gt; [<span class="st">&quot;catlion&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;dogwolf&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;birdeagle&quot;</span>]</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Write a function called <code>is_sorted</code> which takes a list (of number or strings) as a parameter. It should return <code>True</code> if the list is already sorted (ascending order) or <code>False</code> if the list is not sorted.</p>
<p>You can use this function to test your code:</p>

<li><p>What is the Python interpreter’s response to the following?</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="dt">list</span>(<span class="dt">range</span>(<span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>, -<span class="dv">2</span>))</code></pre>
<p>The three arguments to the <em>range</em> function are <em>start</em>, <em>stop</em>, and <em>step</em>, respectively. In this example, <code>start</code> is greater than <code>stop</code>. What happens if <code>start &lt; stop</code> and <code>step &lt; 0</code>? Write a rule for the relationships among <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>step</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a function <code>replace(s, old, new)</code> that replaces all occurrences of <code>old</code> with <code>new</code> in a string <code>s</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">test(replace(<span class="st">&quot;Mississippi&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;i&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;I&quot;</span>) == <span class="st">&quot;MIssIssIppI&quot;</span>)

    <span class="st">&quot;I lave spam! Spam is my favarite faad. Spam, spam, yum!&quot;</span>)</code></pre>
<p><em>Hint</em>: use the <code>split</code> and <code>join</code> methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you want to swap around the values in two variables. You decide to factor this out into a reusable function, and write this code:</p>

<p>Run this program and describe the results. Oops! So it didn’t do what you intended!<br />Explain why not.</p>
<p>Using a Python visualizer like the one at <a href="http://netserv.ict.ru.ac.za/python3_viz">http://netserv.ict.ru.ac.za/python3_viz</a> may help you build a good conceptual model of what is going on.<br />What will be the values of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> after the call to <code>swap</code>?</p></li>

<h1><a href="#contributor-list"><span class="header-section-number">8</span> Contributor List</a></h1>
<p>To paraphrase the philosophy of the Free Software Foundation, this book is free like free speech, but not necessarily free like free pizza. It came about because of a collaboration that would not have been possible without the GNU Free Documentation License. So we would like to thank the Free Software Foundation for developing this license and, of course, making it available to us.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank the more than 100 sharp-eyed and thoughtful readers who have sent us suggestions and corrections over the past few years. In the spirit of free software, we decided to express our gratitude in the form of a contributor list. Unfortunately, this list is not complete, but we are doing our best to keep it up to date. It was also getting too large to include everyone who sends in a typo or two. You have our gratitude, and you have the personal satisfaction of making a book you found useful better for you and everyone else who uses it. New additions to the list for the 2nd edition will be those who have made on-going contributions.</p>
<p>If you have a chance to look through the list, you should realize that each person here has spared you and all subsequent readers from the confusion of a technical error or a less-than-transparent explanation, just by sending us a note.</p>
<p>Impossible as it may seem after so many corrections, there may still be errors in this book. If you should stumble across one, we hope you will take a minute to contact us. The email address (for the Python 3 version of the book) is <code>p.wentworth@ru.ac.za &lt;mailto:p.wentworth@ru.ac.za&gt;</code>__ . Substantial changes made due to your suggestions will add you to the next version of the contributor list (unless you ask to be omitted). Thank you!</p>
