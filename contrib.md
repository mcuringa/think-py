Contributor List 
=========================

More than 100 sharp-eyed and thoughtful readers have sent in suggestions
and corrections over the past few years. Their contributions, and
enthusiasm for this project, have been a huge help.

If you have a suggestion or correction, please send email to
feedback@thinkpython.com. If I make a change based on your feedback, I
will add you to the contributor list (unless you ask to be omitted).

If you include at least part of the sentence the error appears in, that
makes it easy for me to search. Page and section numbers are fine, too,
but not quite as easy to work with. Thanks!
